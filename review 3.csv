And still further, if you save the urine of a person who eats cabbage habitually, heat it, and bathe the patient in it, he will be healed quickly; this remedy has been tested. Also, if babies are bathed in this urine they will never be weakly; those whose eyes are not very clear will see better if they are bathed in this urine; and pain in the head or neck will be relieved if the heated urine is applied. 11 If a woman will warm the privates with this urine, they will never become diseased.

After an RE recommended folic acid (which is NOT the same as methylfolate - 2 different forms of vitamin B9), I discovered that made things worse.  I did my own research and discovered methylfolate.  I took this and the very next pregnancy was carried to full term with a healthy baby as a result.  Not only that though - my chronic fatigue, depression, neurological issues, and memory loss all immediately and dramatically improved.

Folic acid is synthetic and cheap - but it is not what the body uses.  It has to convert it to methylfolate first.

Folic Acid and 5-MTHF or (L-Methylfolate) are different substances.  I wish Web MD would not lump them together.  Folic Acid is synthetic and it likely feeds cancer cells.  Folate occurs naturally in foods.  See this blog for the explanation. http://blog.designsforhealth.com/blog/bid/115121/ Folic-Acid-vs-Folate-Part-I

I hope WEB MD clears this up.  WEB MD is a great site with only occasional  misinformation.  So WEB MD, thanks for the site.

I use Metabolic Maintenance brand, 5-MTHF, or Methylfolate, 10 mg.  This is a generic version of the medical food Deplin.  Read the reviews for Deplin on Web MD. 

 I have just started using it so I can't tell if it is working.   I just wanted to clear up the misinformation of folic acid versus folate (l-methylfolate, 5-MTHF).",12

What is shocking is that I have learned that folic acid feeds cancer cells and helps them to grow.  The surgeons are using it to help them during surgery.  They mix the folic acid with a glowing dye and give it to the patient.  When the body processes the vitamin it goes directly to the malignant cancer cells like a magnet.

  BUT THIS IS THE SHOCKER!!!!  I have learned that Folic Acid feeds cancer cells and helps the cancer to grow.  Now they have found a way to use this to help in surgery.  It is important for the surgeon to get all the malignant cancer cells during surgery.  So they mix a bright glowing dye with the folic acid and give it to the patient.  When the body processes the nutrient it goes straight to the cancer cells and the doctors can recognize the malignant tissue that they want to cut out because the cancer cells light up from the glowing dye in the folic acid.  The healthy tissue around the cancer is not affected because the cancer cells feed off of the folic acid to grow. The folic acid is drawn to the cancer like a magnet as it feeds on the nutrient to grow.  IS THIS TRUE??????  Why oh why aren't we notified of the dangers with some of the vitamins out there?

One thing I *suspect* GB has done is to reduce the severity of a poison ivy rash. I get it late EVERY winter, and this year was no different...except in the severity. I still have the rash and redness all over my arms and some on my legs. However, there are no oozing, weeping blisters.

Last year, it was so bad that it went deeper than the skin and ate into my flesh in one spot...leaving a scar that's still there today. This year, it itches very little, the rash isn't very raised, and as I said, absolutely no blisters.

I'm wondering, because the GB plant can cause an allergic skin reaction, much like poison ivy...is it possible that ingesting the supplement has helped my body counteract the effects of poison ivy?",4

I based this trial on the reading of the new book by Linus Pauling, Vitamin C and the Common Cold. My life changed dramatically as I ceased getting colds as long as I kept taking at least 4-5 grams (4,000-5,000 milligrams) every morning without fail, and then an additional 1-2 grams after supper. Later, I found I needed more, and if I did begin to feel a virus coming on, I found that I had to take extra, up to 8 grams at a time, to stave off or reduce the impact and symptoms and duration. Often I need to then take an additional 2-4 grams every few hours in the first day or two to knock the virus out or almost out. If waiting more than a few hours when the very first symptoms begin to come on, it is less effective. If waiting more than a half a day it may do very little and you get the cold almost as you would without it. One thing I had to start doing after a number of years was take calcium and magnesium with the C to buffer it. I had big problems with ester-C and other pre-buffered C's which were too alkaline and messed up my gut worse than the pure C which is too acidic. I had to find a balance that worked for me. I have also successfully used C to stop the flu from progressing past the first few hours. C is the one vitamin I would never do without, if I could only afford to buy ONE supplement this would be it. I am amazed more people don't use it like my wife and I have learned to do, but you do have to take a LOT for it to really work this way. If you have a very direct exposure to a virus and not enough sleep, etc., then this will only do so much good, but normally it works incredibly well if you take it every day and take enough for you. There were a few times I tried stopping taking it but always got more colds again so went back.",19

The most valuable research information comes from doctor researchers that seek cures, in their treatment of patients and people that seek their own health cures that have worked for them. The profit motivated are very bias and seek to discredit the value of real health information on vitamins, minerals and natural supplements.",12

I have been prescribed klonopin for anxiety in the past, but only took it a few times because of the risk of addiction. So, I began searching for a natural solution to my anxiety problems. I have tried just about every vitamin or supplement that is said to help anxiety...Valerian Root, 5 HTP, B complex caps, and a few others. None of these supplements helped my anxiety like I'd hoped. I read a few articles online about how people with anxiety disorders can benefit from taking Vitamin C. So, I went out and bought some thinking that it was probably not going to work. Well, the day I bought them I took two 500 mg tabs, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. I felt calmer even the first day I took Vitamin C. I have been taking 1000 mg for the last few months and can't believe how I feel. My symptoms of OCD and Panic disorder are greatly reduced. I feel more calm now and I don't get stressed out easily anymore. I would recommend that anyone struggling with an anxiety disorder at least Give Vitamin C a try.

It may be eaten either cooked or raw; if you eat it raw, dip it into vinegar. It promotes digestion marvellously and is an excellent laxative, and the urine is wholesome for everything.114 If you wish to drink deep at a banquet and to enjoy your dinner, eat as much raw cabbage as you wish, seasoned with vinegar, before dinner, and likewise after dinner eat some half a dozen leaves; it will make you feel as if you had not dined, and you can drink as much as you please.

And still further, if you save the urine of a person who eats cabbage habitually, heat it, and bathe the patient in it, he will be healed quickly; this remedy has been tested. Also, if babies are bathed in this urine they will never be weakly; those whose eyes are not very clear will see better if they are bathed in this urine; and pain in the head or neck will be relieved if the heated urine is applied. 11 If a woman will warm the privates with this urine, they will never become diseased.

When I stopped for a few weeks her age-related and

thought processes and mind-body connections became
very impaired making it difficult to communicate
with her effectively and difficult for her to stand or walk a couple feet.  I started giving her
the CoQ 10 again, and it was amazing.  Within 48 hours her previous physical and mental abilities returned.  She can complete her sentences which are again coherent, she can understand what I say,
and she can stand up for 5 minutes, walk across the room and even play Scrabble with me.  Without
the CoQ 10 it had become so difficult to take care
of her at home over a 6-8 week period that I thought I would have to put her in a Care Home. 
I read that Lovastatin causes CoQ 10 deplepletion

thoroughly research how one's medicines may be negatively interacting, (causing reduced or increased absorption or other side effects) and how some medicines can result vitamin and mineral

I am a 60 year old female, and I have been taking co-Q-10 supplements daily for over 20 years.  I began taking it after reading a research paper that indicated that co-Q-10 might be effective in increasing immune response.  My whole life prior to that time, I was extremely susceptible to infections; if someone with the flu or a cold even looked at me across a room, I got sick.  I was constantly sick as a child, and as an adult suffered what seemed like a continuous cold throughout the winter, along with episodes of the flu, bronchitis, etc.  NOTHING helped, not dietary intervention, not the then-popular vitamin C dosage, nothing.  After several months of taking a combined dose of co-Q-10, vitamin E and lecithin (a cocktail suggested in the research paper), I noticed that I was not getting sick as often.  I have continued the same dosage since that time, and I have not had a single cold while taking it.  No colds, no flu, no bronchitis, nothing. I did suspend the dosage for several weeks two or three times, to see if it made a difference.  It did.  Caught a cold.  Started dosage again and returned to cold-free status. (I should note that after reading reports earlier this year that long-term dosage with vitamin E could be harmful, I discontinued the vitamin E portion of the cocktail.  I have not noticed any decrease in effectiveness).   So I am curious to know if there have been any further studies on this effect of co-Q-10.  Is it possible that this could be a placebo effect of such lasting duration?  What say you, experts?  Inquiring minds want to know. ^_^

This specific type of Ubiguinol has relieved all my symptoms. I started at 50mg with no change then to 100mgs with significate relief. I believe the initial problem started because of a statin drug I was taking and I assumed if I stopped taking the statin the muscle pain and weakness would stop but it didn't. As this was unusal I researched looking for anything I could do to relieve the muscle problem and Ubiquinol(Kaneka QH) worked. I since have talked to my doctor and was recommended I increase the dose to 200mgs as I am going to try another statin drug for my high cholesterol. I am also having additional testing for any other condition that may have caused the muscle pain and weakness after stopping the statin. I hope this information might help someone else considering Ubiquinol (Kaneka QH). Do the reshearch for yourself.   ,39

Finally got DIM and begin taking 100mg morning 100mg night. Sleeping tell 6:30-7:30 after one day of DIM . Next is something that I have never experienced. I had 2 weeks before finished a round of antibiotics for a failing root canal and crown. The swelling left a scar on the top part of my gum where the end of the root had abscessed about the size of a pea. My dentist told me when the swelling began to come back to call him so he could get a good x-ray of which root and tooth it was and I was to then start antibiotics again. The abscess had flared on a Thursday dentist closed till Monday. I suffered with it till Sunday morning when i began to feel better. This was after my first day of DIM on Saturday. After doses on Sunday and Monday pain totally gone!!! In three more days all swelling and scar WAS GONE . The DIM has also helped with some allergies I've had for years. I know I'm going to have to get my root canal fixed some day but its been two months and I only feel a little soreness if I forget to take the DIM. I also take a triple strength Omega-3 once a day. Soon as I get my root canal fixed I'll try to go to one 100mg per day. One other thing, by now I've usually had my yearly sinus infection. I'll get back to you on that one.",10

The lignands in flax, like the phytoestrogens bind to the beta estrogen receptor on breast cells, while mammalian estrogen preferrentially binds to the alpha receptor. Estrogen binding to the alpha receptor up regulates cell proliferation while estrogen binding to the beta receptor down regulates cell proliferation. Also only one receptor is available at a time, so a phytoestrogen binding to the beta receptor also has the effect of blocking of an endogenous estrogen from binding to the alpha receptor. As such flax (and soy) phytoestrogens are anticipated to result in a protective effect with respect to estrogen sensitive breast cancer, which corresponds to the observed correlation with reduced breast cancer with increasing soy consumption.",0

I'm not a rocket scientist, but garlic did something to restore my insulin balance.  Can't knock it.  I also am finding that it is helping me to breathe easier (as I have asthma also).  Coincidence?  Don't think so.  Just my 2 cents.  I take the garlic food, not the pill supplements.  Maybe the ingredient allicin in the garlic helps this?  I was informed by a pharmacist that unscented garlic is not as effective, so that is what brought me directly to the food aisle instead.  Glad I did.",3

I can't say for sure if it was the raw garlic, but it really did not suit my digestive system. My digestive system may have been a bit off anyway and the raw garlic acted as a catalyst in making it worse.

If you're first layer of tape is absorbent from the outside in to the skin, you can cover it with another piece of regular tape that will block the garlic juice from getting through the medical tape to protect healthy skin, just don't forget to punch a hole in that layer too before applying the bandaid.  The reason you want medical tape as first layer against skin is that it won't injure skin, which can't be guaranteed with a regular plastic tape, not knowing what chemicals were used on the sticky side.

However, a year ago I began experiencing issues with peripheral vascular disease associated with varicose veins (ulcerations and subcutaneous bleeding on my calves, joint pain and stiffness, planar fasciitis and chronic leg cramps). 

Within weeks of treating my varicose veins with compression stockings and elevation, I noted increased postural tachycardia, which became debilitating after 3 months (could no longer work). While waiting to see my PCP, I came off the melatonin and both my tachycardia and varicose veins began improving significantly. Three weeks after discontinuing its use, the tachycardia disappeared and the varicose veins improved enough to allow me to go without compressions stockings for intervals of several hours.

Have found nothing to explain the correlation but for a study in European Journal of Phramocology, vol 345, 1 March 1998 (NIH medical journal database), where the authors discuss the presence of MT1 & MT2 receptors (to which melatonin binds) in smooth muscle of vascular tissue and their role in vasodilation and constriction, respectively, as an explanation for melatonin’s systemic efficacy.

While my overall condition improved when I discontinued use, I did experience a brief period of cognitive impairment and an uptick in mean blood pressure, the latter of which may require me to seek treatment should it persist. Finally have a follow-up with a cardiologist.

But the problem is, each brand and dose of melatonin (and possibly each ""batch"") is SO different. A few brands have worked consistently better than prescription sleep aids for me, but unfortunately MOST brands are either ineffective, or produce the opposite effect desired (eg, I needed a Xanax to counteract the nervous, gittery feelings, then I still couldn't sleep but at least I wasn't jittery.)

One 3mg brand I like is pretty consistent for me (and $3/month! cheap!), but the same brand has a few other doses, plus a ""dissolvable"" 3mg dose with sweetening added, and of course all the bottles look the same, so I've accidentally bought the wrong ones (or if the right ones were sold out, tried another dose): ALL the other doses of the ""good brand"" didn't work. And the sugary one gave me the ""nervousness"" effect.

After a few YEARS of trying melatonin for sleep (on and off), though I have a decent one now, I really think the FDA should be looking at what these vitamin companies put into these pills. At least there should be consistency from ""batch to batch"" (same brand/dose).

So when you hit luck with a good one, it's very effective. But it really feels like a crapshoot when you open the next bottle. I'd love to put my brand/dose as 5-star satisfaction, but since this review is just ""melatonin"", I've got to consider the rest of my experiences with melatonin. Mostly positive, but even the few times I've gotten ""the jitters"" ...why package and sell a sleep aid that makes insomnia a nightmare? It makes it tempting to go back to prescription meds (where the FDA at least has a say).",69

I like that it is not addictive. I particularly like it when my schedule is irregular and I need to get to bed earlier than normal for an early am appointment. It gets you sleepy in about 20 mins. (of course it's best to start settling down for the evening). It is a dream enhancer though, the higher the dose as in 5-10mg the more one will tend to dream. This can make one feel as though they haven't slept. Best to start with a small dose and increase until you find a dosage that makes you sleepy in the 20 min range. Then go to bed. If you don't your body will just work it through and it will do no good. I also like to combine this with Valerian root which produces a sound sleep. Also non addictive. One of each on any given work night is about the right dose for me.  The melatonin dose is 1mg and the valerian is 500 mg.  I have taken up to 10 mg of melatonin with no ill effects, however you will need 8-11 hours of sleep with that dosage and you may still wake up groggy. I have also taken up to 2000 mg of valerian root with no ill effects and no grogginess (in case you have never taken valerian root it smells like dirty socks, really dirty socks lol).  Both products are relatively inexpensive. My size is 5'4"" and I weight around 145-150. Judge your dosage according to your size. I have used nearly all makes and models of both products",13

Added 50 mg Bendryl (diphenhydramine)per night a few years ago and have not needed to change either dose since. I sleep through the night and wake up refreshed but sometimes a bit groggy. A good cardio workout takes care of that. Very important - try cutting down, or better, eliminating caffeine. 
I've tried a number of brands of melatonin, but many don't work. I've settled on Natrol, because it works. There are probably others that work also, but I haven't seen any reason to experiment unless/until the Natrol becomes unavailable or stops working. Remember that these are not manufactured as drugs and there is no required test for what's in the tablet. If the first brand doesn't work for  you, try others until you find one. That doesn't mean you will necessarily succeed - melatonin doesn't work for everybody. Try it, though. Start with low doses and adjust as you see how it affects you. Good luck!",54

When I did sleep, every third day or so, my sleep was much shorter topping out between 3 and  hours. Then for the 2 days after I stopped taking it I slept about 21 hours a day and was extremely groggy when I was awake (afterwards, that is after the 2 day snooze fest, I returned to my normal insomnia problems.)But the worst side effect, reportedto me by family and coworker, was that while I kept taking the melatonin I was extremely irritable, easily annoyed and angered, not to mention so energized and thinking and talking a mile a minute most of the time when I had to be really alert for work, I guess to compensate my groginess (a sort of adrenaline rush of some kind and I imagine it was like some people feel when on speed or something, or immediately after coming off of it.

1286,37,4/28/2014 9:01:30 PM,Benzodiazepine withdrawal,"John shepherd, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months",3,5,3,"Benzodiazepines cause tolerance and physical dependence within two to four weeks, and, upon cessation acute withdrawal traditionally requires tapered management. Additionally in some long term users experience withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal syndrome can last many months and is typified by a major depressive episode, agitation, and lack of ability to get to sleep. This is a serious side effect which needs careful monitoring.
ol
For this reason Benzodiazepines need to be used with extreme caution and for very short periods.

Melatonin is effective for sleep disturbances that are not caused by an over active nervous system, such is in the case of Benzodiazepine withdrawal. It appears virtually ineffective during acute (tapered) withdrawal, although somewhat helpful during withdrawal syndrome. For this reason it's main purpose during withdrawal is an adjunct with other therapies.

To my knowledge Melatonin does not effect the calcium channels that have been disturbed by benzodiazepine usage and this is why, in my view, Melatonin is not very effective on it's own as an Anxiolytic (antianxiety agent.)

My experience is that SSRI's are not very effective for use for withdrawal, however responses to SSRI's are individual dependant.

It is essential to manage benzodiazepine withdrawal and protracted withdrawal syndrome using a variety of methods including CBT, but most effectively, using an alternative Anxiolytic, the most effective of which is Phenibut (CALMEXA).

Phenibut Calmexa is GABA with a phenyl ring that allows it to pass the blood brain barrier, therefore replacing the GABA depleted by benzodiazepine dependence. With medical management it can safely and entirely replace the use of Benzodiazepines, causing an alternative dependence both easier to taper with less risk of protracted withdrawal syndrome. 

Melatonin used together with Phenibut is very effective for inducing sleep, establishing and maintaining a sleeping pattern.

Trouble falling and staying asleep. Erratic work schedule. I use melatonin infrequently but with extremely high doses (ie used 20mg last night). Result: vivid dreams, but it helps to keep me asleep.

I'm reviewing just to let people know that this dosage is safe for me (I feel well rested, still tired but not wired, not irritable). The dreams are to be looked out for, like I said extremely vivid especially the first couple times using melatonin.
The diagnose of fibro should convey to readers that I have experienced chronic physiological (specifically muscular and nervous system) arousal for prolonged periods of time (10-15 years) due to environmental and emotional stress & poor cultural/familial support for stress resolution.

The hallucinations involved watery vision, where everything resembled liquid waves, and complete distortion of light. I've only experienced something similar in my childhood during a shroom trip.

I take 3mg of melatonin approximately mid-day to advance my sleep phase.  The timing needs to be precise in relationship to my internal body clock, which is not always easy to know.  If I wake after an hour of heavy dream sleep, my waking time is a reliable marker and I will take melatonin eight hours later.  If I hit the right timing window, I'll have fairly strong fatigue within an hour.  This lasts for a couple of hours.  I can't do certain kinds of work in this state, but I can do housework and listen to lectures.  I call it my stupid pill, but it doesn't actually make me stupid, but impairs my ability to generate outward focus.  Missing my window even once can make it hard to recover the required timing accuracy.  The difference is profound.  I can tell I miss the window because I have far less fatigue.  Taking coffee at the same time as the melatonin significantly reduces fatigue, but it also made the treatment less reliable.  Used to have an ""all nighter"" without fail at least once every three weeks for twenty years.  In my first year on melatonin, I lost control only three times and had to flip over.  Variability in the potency messed me up on one of those.  One vendor didn't work at all.  Another vendor works well most of the time, but some bottles aren't all there.  Think I get mild stomach irritation at night, nothing really to complain about, and it could be other things in the pill.  My life is spectacularly better since I discover this, having found the research myself.  Would love to find a 100% consistent formulation.

An employee of GNC told me she took Milk Thistle 3 times a day because it cleans the liver. 
I began taking it 3 X day, religiously. Within a few weeks, all I noticed was that I wasn't drinking as much because I had become more sensitive to alcohols effect. Then I realized I didn't crave it anymore & drank less often. Milk Thistle really helps me to curb my intake. At 48, I've used it for years. If I run out or just get sick of taking pills, it never fails, I start to drink more again. So I buy more Milk Thistle.

Sometimes I´d catch cold and have it either during it and sometimes just post-viral cough that would last for months, and sometimes my cough would trigger off during hours of stress or tension. In my case it used to be so relentless that even a cortisone would cause a minor relief, as opposed to going away completely.

Then my elder brother looked up online and found onion as a recommended remedy. To be very honest I was very skeptical of it given how many popular and centuries remedies such as ginger, turmeric or even honey had had zero effect so far.

So my brother asked my mom to dip an onion in half a glass water (it forms a very basic part the Pakistani kitchen) and after a few hours I began taking it spoon by spoon and it worked like magic. Wow, I´ll never forget that day and the immediate relief that it provided! We´d dip it overnight and I´d take it the following day for 10-12 days and the cough cured completely as I´m off it now.

On my way, I discovered how wonderfully it works even on intestinal inflammation, although I´m yet to find it being listed online as one of its benefits. No, I´m not a patient of inflammatory bowel disease, but I do have IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) and some food often cause me intestinal inflammation. So I now occasionally use it to counter that, and it is great for IBS anyway. It just can´t be made a part of the daily routine though due to the bad breath that it gives.

The last time I had my blood flow checked after using the pomegranate juice for a cpl years the artery they stented had less blood flow than the one they did nothing to...lol  I whole heartedly recommend pomegranate juice for clogged arteries.  I also take magnesium, folic acid, B3, D3 and cayenne pills.  I quit using all the blood thinners, statins, blood pressure meds 9 months after my heart attack and have treated myself with the above items and have been problem free for over 8 years.  Anyone taking those drugs should read the side effects.  I was weak and fatigued all the time on them.  Since I read up and began self medicating I feel I have been rejuvenated.  I would recommend pomegranate and cayenne pills to anyone experiencing clogged artery's.  The other things are for heart health. Recently I have also began using tart cherry juice as it also is an excellent inflammation fighter.  Inflammation is the root cause of 90% of the ailments we as humans experience and pomegranate juice and tart cherry are two of the best inflammation fighters out there.  Both are excellent anti-oxidants!  Cayenne is an excellent plaque remover.  The first three years after my heart attack I took it daily (3 times) and then moved to once a week.  Back then when I experienced chest pain I would again take it daily and within a week I was fine.  I seldom have any chest pain due to my heart anymore and believe when I do it is something else entirely as heartburn.  Oh yeah, eating celery daily works great to lower blood pressure also!

I have a very large prostate according to a diagnosis and very early- in my thirties- on I was urinating a lot and feeling discomfort around urination. When I took saw palmetto that changed, when I didn't take it, the frequent urination and discomfort returned. I have found that good quality saw palmetto makes a big difference- Whole Foods verses Rite Aid for example. Also the dose. When I take it twice a day the difference is more noticeable. The saw palmetto also can impact sexual stamina and comfort comfort. Its not an actual aphrodisiac but it does seem to increase arousal and duration. It isn't viagra or anything but I do feel it makes a difference. I read other reviews that said it didn't work at all and that doctors agree. I honestly think it had to do with the quality of the product and the dose. When I run out and buy some at a drug store or grocery store vitamin section, it really is entirely different. I suggest buying a good quality organic product - The Whole Foods Brand works better than some of the more expensive products at whole foods. Then gradually increase the dose per day until you notice a difference in the number of times you have to pee in a day and if it is uncomfortable and if you have a healthy stream. Once you find that dose that works for you, then maintain that dose for some weeks. Then stop and see if you don't notice a drastic difference.

I've had the problem since my early 20's and it went improperly diagnosed/untreated until just last year.  As of this writing I am 40.  Finally, relief.  If it's permitted, I use Prostate Rx from www.prostaterx.net.  I couldn't find that exact brand under the brand product used under optional information.  The brand that I use does -not- contain zinc or any other ingredients.  My brand contains -only- the saw palmetto liquid extract.

The discomfort from the pressure, and the urgency to urinate were terrible.  Saw Palmetto gave me relief in about a week, and was adequate treatment for over twenty years.  A year ago I needed further treatment so my doctor prescribed Finasteride, which I took for one year.  I lived with the unpleasant side effects of the Finasteride for the year.  At my last exam the doctor was satisfied with the reduced size of my prostate and I was able to go off the Finasteride. Now I take only the Saw Palmetto.  It enabled me to go many years without the need for other intervention, and hopefully I will go many more years without the need for Finasteride again.  However, I am thankful that the Finasteride was available when I needed it.  I would certainly recommend Saw Palmetto for your symptoms, but make sure BPH is all you have before starting it.",25

Then I read an article about skin rashes that were the result of low selenium. A doctor recommended eating two Brazil nuts per day to obtain selenium for this type of rash. So I tried this solution and much to my amazement within three days the itching stopped and by the end of a week the lesion had cleared. Then I substituted a yeast based supplement containing selenium for the Brazil nuts and the rash came right back within days. This result was perplexing. Then I tried a better grade supplement, Swanson Albion Complex Selenium and the rash cleared as it had with the Brazil nuts. So the type of selenium supplement makes a huge difference.

I have successfully used: Transfer Factor Plus, Glutamine Prime, Transfer Factor Belle Vie ( supports healthy female tissues), Transfer Factor Recall (supports a healthy brain), Enumme Toothpast, TF Gel for first aide on closed wounds, bruises and warts!!! and Probiotics all from 4life Research and have not needed to see a doctor or fill a prescription for Shingells, Gingivitis or fever blisters or anything. By way of explanation, my fever blisters were so bad that they ran along the dermatone going down my throat...it felt like I had strep every 3 weeks and it would last for 10 days. All that resolved in the first month of immune support with 4Life Transfer Factors. If I feel the Shingels or fever blisters or anything like a cold or flu coming coming I just triple my dose, add 4Life Glutamine Prime and chill out and the outbreak is thwarted by my immune system. When you take Transfer Factors they confer immunity and sometimes they help you to develop it, and sometimes they just get you through a tough illness quicker...like 24 hours instead of a week or two! I also have never needed a flu shot since I started using 4Life Transfer Factor back in 1998. In all the research I have read there is no indication that a strong immune response is anything but good and that it is a compatable with health and wellness. From what I have read Transfer Factors can be used by anyone except people that have had organ transplants.",5

I guess tumeric can be deemed organic, but the extraction of the concentrate is usually not an organic process- a subtle difference never noted. 
So a product that is supposed to prevent cancer can easily become one that most defintely does.
    An article by Dr. Liva ND RPh states that of the 30 turmeric products he tested, only 2 had levels near the ppm of less than 5 (USP guidelines) at near 6ppm; the next level was 18ppm on up to 3270ppm, all proven detrimental to one's health.
   Products have been recalled by Health Canada which was mandated to test supplements in 2004, some of them tumeric products because of the high levels of 1,2-dichoroethane.
  I also discovered testing is not done in the US nor is not required by the FDA which states that a manufacturer conduct tests only if they 'know' such banned substances have been used.
I assume then it pays not to 'know'. 
What manufacturer who uses a product that is cheaper will pay to discover if it is so because it used such banned substances?

I based this trial on the reading of the new book by Linus Pauling, Vitamin C and the Common Cold. My life changed dramatically as I ceased getting colds as long as I kept taking at least 4-5 grams (4,000-5,000 milligrams) every morning without fail, and then an additional 1-2 grams after supper. Later, I found I needed more, and if I did begin to feel a virus coming on, I found that I had to take extra, up to 8 grams at a time, to stave off or reduce the impact and symptoms and duration. Often I need to then take an additional 2-4 grams every few hours in the first day or two to knock the virus out or almost out. If waiting more than a few hours when the very first symptoms begin to come on, it is less effective. If waiting more than a half a day it may do very little and you get the cold almost as you would without it. One thing I had to start doing after a number of years was take calcium and magnesium with the C to buffer it. I had big problems with ester-C and other pre-buffered C's which were too alkaline and messed up my gut worse than the pure C which is too acidic. I had to find a balance that worked for me. I have also successfully used C to stop the flu from progressing past the first few hours. C is the one vitamin I would never do without, if I could only afford to buy ONE supplement this would be it. I am amazed more people don't use it like my wife and I have learned to do, but you do have to take a LOT for it to really work this way. If you have a very direct exposure to a virus and not enough sleep, etc., then this will only do so much good, but normally it works incredibly well if you take it every day and take enough for you. There were a few times I tried stopping taking it but always got more colds again so went back.",19

I have moderate social phobia, and for the last three years have been experiencing symptoms of OCD and Panic Disorder. I have been prescribed klonopin for anxiety in the past, but only took it a few times because of the risk of addiction. So, I began searching for a natural solution to my anxiety problems. I have tried just about every vitamin or supplement that is said to help anxiety...Valerian Root, 5 HTP, B complex caps, and a few others. None of these supplements helped my anxiety like I'd hoped. I read a few articles online about how people with anxiety disorders can benefit from taking Vitamin C. So, I went out and bought some thinking that it was probably not going to work. Well, the day I bought them I took two 500 mg tabs, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. I felt calmer even the first day I took Vitamin C. I have been taking 1000 mg for the last few months and can't believe how I feel. My symptoms of OCD and Panic disorder are greatly reduced. I feel more calm now and I don't get stressed out easily anymore. I would recommend that anyone struggling with an anxiety disorder at least Give Vitamin C a try.

After a month's interval, I had a strong urgency to go to the bathroom.  This is not presumed to be entirely normal, so I assumed that this was for me a normal metabolic outcome.  I then tried vitamin K2 in supplement form, which I found to lower the heart rate and blood pressure.  But after a time, about 6 weeks,  just 100mcg a day caused restless muscular reactions in my legs.  I switched to 30mcg K2/25 IU MCT Oil Base Sublingual when required.  This was a significant improvement over the supplements, and I was required to administer very judiciously just one tiny drop under the tongue.  This sublingual strategy was so that the K2 goes direct into the blood stream and not processed thru through the liver.  I probably don't require very much of either K2 or D3 noting metabolic effects with supplements such as becoming constipated or having a strong urgency to pee or restless legs, and have probably filled out my requirement.  Noted effects on stopping K2/D3 sublingual was mild heart palpitations, so I will continue in small, judicious amounts and carefully monitor.  Would recommend Boron supplements according to dosage recommendations, or perhaps Potassium Gluconate as they take far longer to fill out the basic requirement.

 After many years of frustration with conventional medicine, I started researching my symptoms on line,( skin pain, joint pain, neuropathy, fatigue, weight gain, and more). My reading led me to vitamin D3 and more reading led me to believe I needed K2 to direct vitamins and minerals from my blood stream and into my bones.
 I went to see my family doctor to ask if she would check my D3 levels, as I intended on increasing my intake to see if it helped my symptoms. 
 I have limped for well over a year due to Mortens neuroma in my left foot. Within a month of taking the D3-K2 combination I have stopped limping. My D3 levels are fine so I plan on increasing my dose to see if there will be more improvement. So far the only side effect is with the D3 (stomach ache, if taken without food.)

In general I am diligent about taking my maintenance medication twice a day but with the addition of Black Seed Oil I was down to one puff 1 -2 times a day. My asthma was managed so well I often forgot to take my inhaler at night. Ran out of Black Seed Oil and noticed an increase in asthma symptoms at the 7th day. Only downside I have noticed is I burp black seed oil if I do not take it with food.,9

After taking 400 mgs of ground nigella sativa in capsule form for 10 days I do not notice an improvement in sex drive, but worse still, it seems to dampen my mood. This 'cure for all panacea' was supposed to lift my mood instead of causing depression. I also noticed another poster writing that this stuff disabled the effectiveness of his anti-depressant medication, so maybe there is a link. I also noticed dryer mouth, maybe due to it's link to tryptophan (which gives me the same reaction)?

Within a couple days I noticed that I was much calmer, & optimistic. It was only due to the lack of dark, ominous, anxious feelings I had my whole life that I had never before noticed, that I realized I had suffered anxiety my whole life.

After I discovered CBD's affect, I then tried other forms of CBD, vape, capsules, etc. I finally settled on CBD oil tincture taken under the tongue after much research. I take 10-15 mg twice a day under my tongue.

The CBD industry is not regulated closely by the US government. As such, it is buyer beware. The only way to confirm a CBD seller's claims of potency & purity is to view the test results of their product. In the industry it is called a ""Certificate of Analysis"". The certificate of analysis will document that the CBD content is what is claimed, & that the product is contaminant-free.

After all of my research & trials I settled on one company. Their site provides valuable information on CBD, has superior products, & has the certificates of analysis for each specific product (batch codes on pkg ties to COA's posted on website).
The company is Optimum Botanicals: www.optimumbotanicals.com

I hope you have similar results.",5

Its calmed her down significantly and her anxiety is non-existent. Recently Her ability to focus has been on a fast incline.
Her teacher also noticed a change, behavior has vastly improved and she's not having random out-o-nowhere anger flare-ups or tantrums anymore. We have both noticed she's more aware of her soundings and not as distracted into repetitive

Simultaneously, my depressed mood improved very significantly. Chicken or the egg?  Both joint pain/mobility AND MOOD improved so significantly AND SO QUICKLY that I believe that the two were not significantly interrelated. Because dosage can be so confusing, I am providing the brand name, etc. I took ""Nature Made Fish Oil 1200 mg"", 360 mg Omega-3 twice daily.

However, after reading reviews/ratings here, I may consider increasing this dosage from 2 to 3 softgels daily.  Thanks so much to all contributors!  This is an awesome resource for information!  Scientific studies necessarily lag behind first-hand experiences...

I take 2000 mg of omega 3s in fish oil daily with fluoxetine (Prozac) and it makes a HUGE difference.  I drive much slower, I'm much more patient, and people don't aggravate me half as much.

Fish oil works by reducing inflammation in the brain on a sub-cellular level which allows the neurotransmitters in the brain to be able function more efficiently without misfiring (which is believed to be the cause of many mood disorders).

Regardless if you're suffering general anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, or any number off issues, fish oil will only help.

Be sure to read the label, just because it says 1000 mg on the bottle means very little.  What is important are how many mg of actual omega 3s are in each capsule.  Most drug store brands have about 300mg of omega 3s and to be effective for mood disorders, you need 2000-3000 mgs of omega 3s daily.  Specifically EPA.

If fish oil prevents blood clotting, ie thickening of blood,and can cause bleeding from the liver,, would taking this krill oil be causing me to lose iron? Just wanted to chime in with my theory. I think Ill stop taking it for awhile. The body doesnt need much fat. Hormones are made from chlorestorel. But think of the body as mostly water. What happens when you put oil, in water? It floats. Think of your blood. Basically, the oil is greasing up your blood. I have read studies about vit e and estrogen that state estrogen is inactive until activated by e, e is an oil. when activated by the wrong oil, it can trigger cancer. I even wonder if the body needs ANY external oils at all. This states that the omegas are not naturally made in the body. Then why supplument them? I looked up what oil actually is, and this is really gross, but oil is decaying life, ie human, and animal remains over millions of years. I think Ill work to keep my body as watery as possible. ",0

Recently, my primary physician prescribed Lovaza. It is a more pure form of Omega 3 fish oil. It has worked well, in lowering triglycerides. It has also caused fewer fish burps, even though it is not enteric-coated. However, I have started developing intestinal problems, (bloating, gastritis, diarrhea, upper abdominal pain) after taking the fish oil. 
I always take Omega 3 with a meal, but the symptoms have become so uncomfortable, that I have stopped it. I even tried the over the counter capsules again, and I am getting the same side effects. 
I am sure it is the Fish oil causing stomach distress, after the process of eliminating all other possible causes. I may give myself a rest for a few weeks and try again, but intestinal problems are some of the side effects listed for all Omega 3 fish oils.

There's no *perceptible* difference that I can feel, and the very latest research from Yale, where the scientists combed through all the studies, is that the studies just don't show a connection between ingestion of EPA/DHA and relief of bipolar or depressive symptoms.  Michael Bloch's team at Yale found that there was no *meaningful* connection between use of DPA/EHA and these disorders.  (The article: Mol Psychiatry. 2012 Dec;17(12):1272-82. doi: 10.1038/mp.2011.100. Epub 2011 Sep 20.).

Then again, the research does indicate that omega-3s are helpful for cardiac pathology, and certainly they don't *harm* you, so I'm going to keep taking them.  I'm just going to be careful not to spend a fortune on them, and not to ignore other treatment options and put all my eggs in the Omega-3 basket.

The first 6 months went fine - no adverse events, but not much effect on the triglycerides. After 6-8 months, I slowly developed irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). I had been on the fish oil for so long, it did not occur to me that it could be the cause. The IBS slowly got worse to the point where I was tested for celiac disease and gluten intolerance - negative on both fronts. The IBS got to the point where I was having up to ten BM's a day - not diarrhea, just constantly in the bathroom. It was miserable -it was hard to go out for even a few hours. It actually caused me to change jobs from a 70% travel position to an inside position. I saw the 2013 NEJM data on the ineffectiveness of fish oil in cardiac conditions, saw my doc and told him I was going to discontinue the fish oil because it wasn't doing anything for the triglycerides and I saw no long term benefit. 4 weeks later ALL my IBS symptoms were gone. I told my doc and he was as shocked as I was - he'd never seen delayed onset IBS with fish oil. So if you have developed IBS in fish oil, talk to your doc and tell him that it can happen.

I took this and the very next pregnancy was carried to full term with a healthy baby as a result.

Folic acid is synthetic and cheap - but it is not what the body uses.  It has to convert it to methylfolate first.

I purchase pure GABA in bulk online, with no other ingredients. I dissolve the powder in water and take it by mouth an hour before bed. 

Subjectively, I feel very relaxed. There is pain relief in my lower back. I find it very easy to fall asleep, within 15 minutes, as most nights I toss/turn for about 30 minutes to an hour.

I am less anxious during the day. I'm not sure if this is because I've been sleeping better, or because of the GABA itself.

Some side effects I experience are shortness of breath and an itching sensation similar to when I take Niacin. Both of these subside within 10 to 20 minutes.

With better sleep and a general state of calm throughout my day, I would recommend GABA.

I've heard some skeptical people claim that GABA does not work because it cannot cross the BBB (Blood Brain Barrier). I cannot overlook my experience and results for their theories, and neither should you.

I had to learn not to take too much GABA because it does relax all your muscles including your breathing which can be very disconcerting. It has replaced the prescription meds and truly helps the spasms ease off. The other day the Dystonia flared up and I couldn't turn my neck to the left because the muscles had tightened so hard on the right.  I took a strong dose of GABA and within an hour I could feel the muscles start to loosen up and I took another dose a couple of hours later and then could start to turn my head to the left again. I have been taking GABA since 2007, 6 years, and I can go without taking it when the Dystonia isn't acting up and suffer no withdrawal effects.  You need to learn how to take it so that you find your theraputic dose without impacting your breathing or the tingling in your face.  If you feel those effects you have taken too much. I've also noticed that if I take a dose on an empty stomach you will feel the effects of the GABA more quickly and stronger.  If you've eaten you may need to take a little more GABA to get the muscle relaxing affect.

Because I can only take Tylenol and narcotics for pain relief I had to stop taking NAC since Tylenol and NAC  cancel each other out. My father with Asperger's took 1200 mg NAC daily for the last three years of his life. I provided him with NAC so he would continue taking it. What I noticed is the my father was noticeably happier since he no longer had OCD in the form of obsessing about past events ad nauseum and talking about it incessantly while taking NAC. My father's mother also exhibited that behavior. I could not get my son to take NAC. Since he is bipolar type 1 as well as has Asperger's a dose of 2400 mg/day is more in line with his needs. My son also has the form of OCD where he would obsess over past events. Being impulsive this type of OCD can get him into loads of trouble - interpersonally and with the law.,38

If adding NAC stops the action of the anticancer agent, than it is assumed it was acting through oxidative action. In April 2010, Korean researchers reported on the action of NAC in combination with a proteosome inhibiting chemotherapy drug known as MG132.

 

 First they showed that MG132 increased the amounts of ROS in lung cancer cells and as expected, the drug slowed the rate of growth of the cancer cells. Then they treated the cancer cells with NAC.  The drug no longer slowed growth rates.

Someone at a health food store told me her brother has the same problem, and said he takes NAC once a day on an empty stomach and its much better. I started using it (I have to take Pepcid or Tagamet with it or it will make my stomach burn a lot). I was already using an asthma inhaler, ProAir, once or twice a day, and was coughing up thick yellow mucus for about an hour after using the inhaler.

After using the inhaler and NAC for a month, the mucus became less thick, and lost the dark yellow color.  I've been using it for about 3 months now, and don't need the inhaler any more!  I'm using it every 3-4 days just to be sure my lungs are still clear and they are. 

I am just getting over what was either a sinus infection or respiratory infection and had no mucus at all, and am feeling much better after being sick for about a week.  

This is the first time since about 1990 that I've gotten over a respiratory infection without antibiotics!!!  Last year I filled about 23 prescriptions for antibiotics.  I've had enough of that.

My doctor likes NAC and wants a lot of her patients to take it. Next time I see her I'm going to tell her about this.  If I don't get the respiratory infections all the time any more, it's a miracle!!",48

By way of explanation, my fever blisters were so bad that they ran along the dermatone going down my throat...it felt like I had strep every 3 weeks and it would last for 10 days. All that resolved in the first month of immune support with 4Life Transfer Factors. If I feel the Shingels or fever blisters or anything like a cold or flu coming coming I just triple my dose, add 4Life Glutamine Prime and chill out and the outbreak is thwarted by my immune system. When you take Transfer Factors they confer immunity and sometimes they help you to develop it, and sometimes they just get you through a tough illness quicker...like 24 hours instead of a week or two! I also have never needed a flu shot since I started using 4Life Transfer Factor back in 1998.

They can cause severe, even fatal, allergic reactions (even in people who have not had reactions to previous stings), and the bee dies after envenomating what it thinks is an enemy or threat. 

Those who claim they've been ""cured"" by bee sting ""therapy"" are kidding themselves -- MS is a disease with a pattern of relapses and remissions. If one's disease happens to go into remission sometime after a bee sting session, that does not constitute proof of a causal link between the stings and the remission.  My experience with bee sting therapy is illustrative for being the opposite: I tried bee sting therapy a week prior to suffering what has been the worst exacerbation I have EVER experienced since my diagnosis in 1999. I spent 19 days in hospital with that flare, and 10 months in intensive physical therapy recovering my ability to stand and walk. Do I blame bees? No.  I have MS. 

Multiple Sclerosis a scarily unpredictable disease for which there are a small, but growing, number of treatments that actually modify the course of its progression.

The CBD industry is not regulated closely by the US government. As such, it is buyer beware. The only way to confirm a CBD seller's claims of potency & purity is to view the test results of their product. In the industry it is called a ""Certificate of Analysis"". The certificate of analysis will document that the CBD content is what is claimed, & that the product is contaminant-free.

After all of my research & trials I settled on one company. Their site provides valuable information on CBD, has superior products, & has the certificates of analysis for each specific product (batch codes on pkg ties to COA's posted on website).

I also take daily vitamins, C, D3/K2/A, B-complex with extra B6, magnesium and natural thyroid. I also took measures in my home and personal products to remove any hormone and endocrine system disruptors that cause estrogen dominance symptoms. Look up Progestelle and Womens Voices for the Earth for help. Any Western GYN who will tell you that primrose oil causes more problems is due to the fact that they have ZERO training or expertise in nutrition and supplementation. They are not trained for wellness/health or an ounce of nutritional knowledge, they are trained to attack symptoms of illness with synthetic pharmaceuticals and surgery. Remember it is a business and they will only use modalities that make money. I should know, I have been a healthcare professional for 20 years and have extended training to the natural way because it is the only way out of this mess. Your body does not recognize synthetic substances with chemicals and additives in pharmaceuticals. At best they just mask the symptoms while your body is now required to deal with another foreign substance when it is already being blasted with chemicals throughout our environment.",19

I take 2000 mg of omega 3s in fish oil daily with fluoxetine (Prozac) and it makes a HUGE difference.  I drive much slower, I'm much more patient, and people don't aggravate me half as much.

Fish oil works by reducing inflammation in the brain on a sub-cellular level which allows the neurotransmitters in the brain to be able function more efficiently without misfiring (which is believed to be the cause of many mood disorders).

Regardless if you're suffering general anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, or any number off issues, fish oil will only help.

Be sure to read the label, just because it says 1000 mg on the bottle means very little.  What is important are how many mg of actual omega 3s are in each capsule.  Most drug store brands have about 300mg of omega 3s and to be effective for mood disorders, you need 2000-3000 mgs of omega 3s daily.  Specifically EPA.

I hope this helps ..",6

If fish oil prevents blood clotting, ie thickening of blood,and can cause bleeding from the liver,, would taking this krill oil be causing me to lose iron? Just wanted to chime in with my theory. I think Ill stop taking it for awhile. The body doesnt need much fat. Hormones are made from chlorestorel. But think of the body as mostly water. What happens when you put oil, in water? It floats. Think of your blood. Basically, the oil is greasing up your blood. I have read studies about vit e and estrogen that state estrogen is inactive until activated by e, e is an oil. when activated by the wrong oil, it can trigger cancer. I even wonder if the body needs ANY external oils at all. This states that the omegas are not naturally made in the body. Then why supplument them?

Michael Bloch's team at Yale found that there was no *meaningful* connection between use of DPA/EHA and these disorders.  (The article: Mol Psychiatry. 2012 Dec;17(12):1272-82. doi: 10.1038/mp.2011.100. Epub 2011 Sep 20.).

Then again, the research does indicate that omega-3s are helpful for cardiac pathology, and certainly they don't *harm* you, so I'm going to keep taking them.  I'm just going to be careful not to spend a fortune on them, and not to ignore other treatment options and put all my eggs in the Omega-3 basket.

The IBS got to the point where I was having up to ten BM's a day - not diarrhea, just constantly in the bathroom. It was miserable -it was hard to go out for even a few hours. It actually caused me to change jobs from a 70% travel position to an inside position. I saw the 2013 NEJM data on the ineffectiveness of fish oil in cardiac conditions, saw my doc and told him I was going to discontinue the fish oil because it wasn't doing anything for the triglycerides and I saw no long term benefit. 4 weeks later ALL my IBS symptoms were gone.

Last year, it was so bad that it went deeper than the skin and ate into my flesh in one spot...leaving a scar that's still there today. This year, it itches very little, the rash isn't very raised, and as I said, absolutely no blisters.

My experience has been first hand. Herbs dosages are critically important for some herbs. Ginkgo like yohimbe and ginseng is very concentrated and has powerful effects most commonly than not. We are far too reckless with these. I wouldn't experiment with Ginkgo unless a last resort is very necessary. Its your brain after all. Use a detox instead for your brain. Adrenals and hormone levels have been my first concern for aging fatigue, hair loss and male sexual function. For me Ginkgo is no good at all and difficult to be free of the side effects. Worse than chromium picolinate and may last years longer.

I first began taking it sporadically due to cartilage breakdown in my knee and had great pain relief in my early 20's.  I now have osteoarthritis in my knee and ankle and would never even consider letting myself run out.

I would recommend taking 500 mg every 8 hours regularly, at the same times each day, for best effectiveness.  I also find I get my best relief from regular Glucosamine (shellfish-free) which is a great savings in money as it is so much cheaper than Chondroitin/MSM added varieties.  I can actually feel a huge increase in my pain with only just a 24 hour lack of my Glucosamine.  I don't get full relief of course, but would never be able to walk or get in/out of a car without it.

So i tried it on mysef again, but this time used plain Glucosamine SULFATE.  It didn't take long for me to start feeling a difference.....and my severe knee pain was reduced to nothing over time.  I have been using it ever since and can tell right away if I foget to take it or if a diff brand does not work as it should. Glucosamine SULFATE (not Glucosamine HCL) is the form originally studied for joint pain relief and is far more effective in my experience.  I am amazed that most of the products use Glucosamine HCL instead of Sulfate, but an earlier writer noted that Sulfate is more expensive to manufacture, which may explain it.  If you have not had success with the HCL form, try the Sulfate form before giving up on this miracle supplement.  Be sure to get a quality brand, too, because some are not as effective as others. Once you use one that works, you will be able to tell pretty quickly if you switch to one that is not as effective.  Good Luck!",78

A friend recommended that take a suplement of Magnesium and gave me a bottle of 300 mg tablets.
After a week I did not experience any cramps for 2 to 3 months.
Recently I have started to experience increased pain due to rumatism in my shoulder and hands so I did a little ""Self Diagnosis"" and thought the Magnesium might be causing it.
I took my self off the Magnesium supplement! Well a week or so later the Cramps were back and no reduction in artritus pain.
SO I AM BACK ON THE MAGNESIUM and no more Cramps!
I am taking the Magnesium as ""Magnesium Oxide""
I need some information about Magnesium's absorption into the body.
Is Magnesium Malate or Magnesium Glycenate better absorbed and does Calcium supplements inhibit the Magnesium absorption by the body?",20

I am taking the magnesium side by side with 26 billion active bacteria (probiotics) each day.  I take these right before bed when I take my magnesium (because both give me putrid gas for several hours).  This is a side effect not mentioned on the labels of either product.  FYI.  But this it is the only adverse side effect I’ve noticed that I have!  The combination of these two supplements has really improved my mood and overall sense of well being.  Anxiety and negative thinking is now rare and very short lived.  I no longer feel bloated because the digestive tract and bowels are moving, and I have more energy and a positive outlook.  I am amazed that probiotics can actually improve your mental acuity, focus and sense of well being!  Everybody should take these!

I didn't have depression, anxiety, or any mood disorder; apart from the hair-pulling, I was completely healthy. After stopping Abilify cold-turkey (my doctor at the time told me this would be okay; she was WAY wrong), I experienced an intense 5-day-long anxiety attack.  Just constant panic, depression, crying, and depersonalization. On day 5, the ""episode"" ended just as suddenly as it began.

Ever since then, I'd have weeks of normalcy--even a slight euphoria--and then about 3 days of anxiety and depression that would, again, start without warning, and end just as suddenly.  Sometimes it was 3 days, sometimes more; sometimes it was so bad I couldn't function. Some episodes were more mild, but still very disrupting my life. I also began to pull more hair than ever.

I saw many doctors and was diagnosed with everything from General Anxiety, to Postpartum Depression (I gave birth a year ago), to Bipolar disorder. I knew in my heart the Abilify had caused this, somehow.

I read in a few forums about people having great success with TwinLab Amino Fuel, L-glutamine powder, and magnesium (all three taken together in the mornings on an empty stomach--I take 40 mL, 1 teaspoon, and 250 mg, respectively). I decided to give it a try, since I was desperate, and Abilify had scared me off psychiatric drugs permanently.

Within a week, I felt a LOT better. I started taking another 250 mg magnesium before bed, and now (2 months later) I feel even better, almost 100%. I do get ""twinges"" of anxiety now and then, but they are so mild and fleeting, I barely notice them; on these days I take an extra magnesium midday. I know the other supplements are helping a lot too, but the magnesium is great just by itself. It feels like I have my life back!! Highly recommend no matter what kind of anxiety you have.",73

I had my gallbladder removed as a teen and have suffered with Irritated Bowel Syndrome for decades. These issues made taking the HIV meds a big deal as they wreak havoc even on a healthy digestive system. I tried using pharmaceuticals to stop the nausea and vomiting but if you can't keep the pills down they can't work. Marijuana works so much faster - instant relief, as well as having been inhaled instead of ingested, there wasn't the concern you get with deciding whether it's safe to take another pill after vomiting. 
As well the marijuana helps to keep my appetite reasonable. This is also an issue with HIV meds. It's hard to stay healthy if you don't eat properly on top of worries that you won't keep down what you do eat.
There are three different types of marijuana, the main two being Sativa and Indica. Indicas are the strain you want for nausea control and appetite. I personally don't get much relief from the sativa strain and the third, ruderalis is uncommon. As well, out of the few people that find they get anxiety or paranoia, it is more often than not brought on by a sativa.  
That brings me to the method of acquiring. Medical marijuana clinics are your best bet. I find they may charge more for the higher quality strains as well as the organics and imports, but you are able to chose from a wider selection. Besides strain names and types, often average levels of THC and cannabinoids for each strain are given. This really helps you get the relief you need and not something for treating pain when nausea control is needed or vise versa. 
Another great bonus to medical marijuana clinics are their variety of edibles, tinctures, sprays and drinks now available. You don't HAVE to smoke marijuana to get relief. Ingesting works as good and even better for some patients. Some clinics are also said to be looking to stock suppositories as they would be even more effective. ",2

Do not want opiates and ibuprofen does not work.  Marijuana illegal in my state but I had a MD who mentioned it to me but could not endorse it since it is illegal.  Tried sativa strain but the kind I tried actually made the pain worse.  Tried a hybrid of sativa and indica and pain was gone.  Also have put indica now which also relieves most pain.  I only use it in the evening just like I would any kind of drug that may effect my driving.  Very satisfied with it and I do not understand why it is illegal.  I use a vaporizer instead of smoking it.  Only thing I don't like about Marijuana is that it makes me hungry.  I smoked some marijuana for different reasons when I was in my 30's.  Still probably safer than alcohol to use unless you are on a diet.",18

Likely cause-stressors: Inactivity, prolonged sitting. Muscle cramping.

Method of use (mode of delivery):

Cannabinoid tincture

Recipe: 1 ounce ground herb and fat-soluble solvent (vegetable, alcohol, or honey-based)

I used grain alcohol (everclear, highest percent) and place the herb in a mason jar. Then, after pouring enough everclear to cover top, I closed container and shook for 3 minutes. Then, open, strain thoroughly with cheesecloth, and bottle up just the solution (cannabinoid solutes dissolved into fat-soluble solvent).

Simply, soaked half of a towel in the TINCTURE, rang it out, and applied topically with bandage to wrap in place. 

No side effect risks associated with applying cannabinoids topically (doesn't get you high), other than potential allergy to solute (cannabis, pesticides, etc..) or solvent (alcohol, glycerin, olive oil).

Effects were immediate (5-15 minutes) and lasted moderately (3-5 hours). I left it on the whole duration pain-free in my computer chair studying articles (studies) that explain how cannabioids promote cancer cell autho-phagy, apoptosis, anti-metastasis, anti-angiogenesis, and anti-proliferation without risk of death or SERIOUS addiction (no deadly withdrawal; no violent drug-seeking behaviors) or toxicity to organs.

I nearly died from variceal bleeding 1 year ago which is when I was diagnosed.  I had learned many years ago that Milk Thistle Concentrated Extract would cleanse the toxins in the liver.  Nothing prescribed for me reduced the horrible pain in my liver.  I could not eat or drink anything either.  I continued to pass blood in my yellow,stool.  After one week of taking 1000mg Concentrated Extract of Milk Thistle twice daily, I began to see and feel improvements.  My stool has since returned to normal, no more nose bleeds or excruciating pain!  I can sleep lying on my left side now.  My Primary Physician/Internist SCOFFED at the idea of a herbal supplement being the solution however, my Gastroenterologist stated that he didn't know what I was doing but to keep doing whatever ""it"" was because it is working!  There have been times the Milk Thistle had to be be reordered for stock and the longest I went was one week without it upon which time I redeveloped the pain and misery I previously endured.  This happened twice within one year, however, after 24 hours of re-establishing the Milk Thistle back into my system, I began to heal again.  I should add that this supplemental therapy was used in conjunction with Prayer.  The combination has been a Godsent Blessing for me.  It has not only restored my physical well being but has also extended my life.  I was not diagnosed to live past a few months.  As of August 28th, 2012 it will be one year.      ",37

An employee of GNC told me she took Milk Thistle 3 times a day because it cleans the liver. 
I began taking it 3 X day, religiously. Within a few weeks, all I noticed was that I wasn't drinking as much because I had become more sensitive to alcohols effect. Then I realized I didn't crave it anymore & drank less often. Milk Thistle really helps me to curb my intake. At 48, I've used it for years. If I run out or just get sick of taking pills, it never fails, I start to drink more again. So I buy more Milk Thistle.

It is responsible for inflammatory and anti-inflammatory respoonses. It is a blood thinner vasodilator and anti-coagulant. It regulates hormones. It is good for hair skin and nails. It brings oxygen into the cell. There is a lot of information on omega 6 but not popularly related. Omega 6 is usually processed and heated which is why it has become the bad boy of health.

My migraines that B2 fixes are food ingredient caused migraines. Many ingredients are industrial processed, used in most foods today and using a migraine prescription med is not safe everyday, and causes rebound migraines. As someone else said, B2 clears quickly, so multiple X per day might be good for others. I learned, for me, it works only when taken with the meal that can have ingredients I don't tolerate. 20 yrs ago I tried this, starting with a 50mg pill in the morning. I thought I would have to go to the emergency room, as it felt like I drank 50 cups of coffee. It cleared before I went, but never tried it again, wondering how others could take 400mg.

I would urge anyone who takes large amounts of one particular B vitamin to also take a good B-complex, as all B-vitamins need to work together. High levels of just Riboflavin used for a prolonged period of time can lead to cataracts. Butterbur works well, as does Feverfew. My research and personal experience shows that some people do not tolerate B-vitamins that are not methylated. Malabsorption of B2, B6, B9 and B12 can lead to high homocysteine levels in the body, which become toxic and are responsible for migraines and other unpleasant conditions. Google ""methylated B vitamins,"" and see that the inability of a person to methylate their B6, B9 and B12 can be genetic and run in families. Luckily, it is possible nowadays to find B-vitamin complexes in which those components are already methylated for us. It is advisable for people with these genetic markers to stop taking vitamin B complexes that contain unmethylated B6, B9, and B12, as it will destroy the delicate new balance. With this regime, which does include Riboflavin, I am not only keeping migraines at bay, but have stopped having food and environmental allergies (PABA works for the latter) and my digestion is much improved.",46

Most reviewers here and on Amazon take 400 mg a day. I say start small. I take 200 mg (2 pills) a day on first break with FOOD. Food prevents upset stomach associated with taking vitamins. I also drink it down with Emergen-C. 

That's all! After a week up it if it doesn't feel like enough. 

I have been doing this for over a year and have only had one brief migraine - 2 weeks ago. I don't take it on the weekends because breakfast isn't routine for me on weekends. I do occasionally get a mild headache on a weekend here and there and will remember to take the B2. It goes away pretty quick.

No noticeable side effects. Yes, neon urine! 

Definitely an Affordable option other migraine sufferers should check out. 

I love the TwinLabs capsules because they are small (very small). Even if you had to take four, no problem! 

I will probably have to take these for life! Small price compared to the chemicals the doctors will prescribe and what they will do to your body 10 years from now.

I hope this helps!

I have successfully used: Transfer Factor Plus, Glutamine Prime, Transfer Factor Belle Vie ( supports healthy female tissues), Transfer Factor Recall (supports a healthy brain), Enumme Toothpast, TF Gel for first aide on closed wounds, bruises and warts!!! and Probiotics all from 4life Research and have not needed to see a doctor or fill a prescription for Shingells, Gingivitis or fever blisters or anything. By way of explanation, my fever blisters were so bad that they ran along the dermatone going down my throat...it felt like I had strep every 3 weeks and it would last for 10 days. All that resolved in the first month of immune support with 4Life Transfer Factors. If I feel the Shingels or fever blisters or anything like a cold or flu coming coming I just triple my dose, add 4Life Glutamine Prime and chill out and the outbreak is thwarted by my immune system. When you take Transfer Factors they confer immunity and sometimes they help you to develop it, and sometimes they just get you through a tough illness quicker...like 24 hours instead of a week or two! I also have never needed a flu shot since I started using 4Life Transfer Factor back in 1998. In all the research I have read there is no indication that a strong immune response is anything but good and that it is a compatable with health and wellness. From what I have read Transfer Factors can be used by anyone except people that have had organ transplants.",5

I ingest a food or substance (like maltodextrin)

none of the prescription or over-the-counter pain
meds I have tried have helped with the bone pain.
I found out that I had become calcium-depleted from heavy-metal poisoning from a medical implant.
The intense bone pain has consistently responded to Calcium Supplementation which I take along with Magnesium and now Vitamin D.  These 3 working together have helped decrease the widespread muscle pain I experience part of every day. After
years of depletion and mineral imbalances because 
to the level levels of metal in my body, it is a
daily process to keep the muscle pain away or at least at much lower levels.  I no longer experience the bone pain at all unless I forget
to take these supplements for a few days. The
muscle pain is much trickier to control but I know
from experience that for me dietary restrictions,
Calcium/Magnesium in equal amounts and Vitamin D
especially when I can't get out in the sunshine are essential in controlling the recurring widespread muscle pain/spasms.
Reading others negative experiences with Vitamin D, I know first hand sensitivity response
reactions to foods, medicines, and additives that
others handle well.  But also I notice and have
experienced myself that doctors often prescribe
very large doses for all their patients without
starting them out at a lower dose (which may even
be equally effective) to try to minimize any sensitivity reactions or adverse side effects.
After 6 months on a certain medicine, I asked my doctor if she would increase my dose a little bit.  She ""tripled"" my dosage abruptly without ""titrating"" it upward slowly as recommended. 50,000 IU sounds like a lot

Muscle and Bone Pain
Are Vitamin D Side Effects


This is a side effect of vitamin d that is not so easy to remedy and is actually a sign that you really NEED TO CONTINUE taking the vitamin d. If you experience Pain from Vitamin D this very likely means that your bones have become somewhat demineralized from having vitamin d deficiency for a very long time. When your bones are demineralized and you begin Vitamin D Therapy, this can cause calcium to begin to go back into the bones. When the calcium goes into the bones it drags fluids with it. This fluid can actually cause a small expansion of the 'collagen matrix' inside the bones and this expansion pushes out against the exterior covering of the bone which is very inflexible and has extensive nerve endings. 

When this occurs, you can experience this as bone pain or even muscular pain. If you experience new or worsening pain from taking vitamin d, it is NOT Vitamin D Contraindication, a reason to be scared or to stop taking the vitamin d. If you continue with the Vitamin D Therapy, the pain should subside in several weeks. While uncomfortable, you will be better off in the long run if you manage the pain for this time and 'get through' to the other side.

I take 5,000IU daily and have had no problems. Ingredients are soybean oil, gelatin, glycerin and corn oil.
I have also notice a decrease in my waist size (pants fitting loosely). Did a little more research and found that belly fat starts to ""melt away"" when you get the correct amount of vitamin D3.

I have had bone pains and fatigue when initially taking vits/minerals but it went away after a month. I look at it like this - after exercising, the typical feeling is soreness.  Upon consumption of anything, our bodies will experience some sort of physical/emotional/biological feeling because the body is trying to ""purify"" itself.  Symptoms and side effects are not the same thing.  Check with your Dr about what you're feeling and determine whether it is due to (in this case) Vitamin D, or if the Vitamin D is rebuilding your body and the pain is just part of the process.

It is about a year ago, my doctor said my D level is only 10.xx. I still can not handle D supplement in low does after that extreme dry mouth and eyes experience at 2 months ago.

Here is what happened to me in the past 1 year. 

1. No problem when I start took 50,000 iu once a week for few weeks. Its is D3 from fish with doctor's prescription.

2. Over energy when I took it few times a week. So, doctor want me take 2000 iu daily. But, I only took 1000iu two or three times a week. 

3. Maybe dry eye (not dry mouth yet) start when I took 1000iu every other day. I know I have dry eye issue because all new contact lens cause my eye dry. But, this maybe because I am almost 50, so dry eyes is very normal in my age when I wear contact lens. 

4. Check D level again, only 25. So, doctor still wants me to take up to 2000 iu per day.

5. I start experience extreme dry eye and dry mouth after had took 1800 iu or 15000iu per day. By the way, I also start took Calcium with D at that time.

6. Finally, I called doctor, and stop taking any D and Cal supplements. 

7. After stop it for few days, no extreme dry issue anymore, but still feel dry eyes, and still not dare to wear contact lens.

8. After stop a month, I feel much better, but still dry eyes (not extreme). Check D level again, it drop back to 10.50.

9. I try on very low does D once a while, all caused my extreme dry. D 400iu supplement, a cup of milk with D, or a cup of almond milk with D for few days.

Now, I decide stop any food or drink with D supplement at least 3 months. I am not sure what I am going to next.

After my unpleasant D experience, I start vitamin supplement searching, I found a lot of supplement also contains herbs. I also found 1 of my Cal + D supplement does contains a herb which I better keep away.

Dr. took blood panel & didn’t even mention my vitamin D score @ 15. When I researched it on my own I asked for the recommended 50,000 iu (D2) once a week for 8 wks. She said “I’ve been a dr. for 30 some years & vitamins are at the bottom rung of things that can be wrong with you.” She advised seeing a psychiatrist.

I gave her the name of Michael Holick MD, a pioneer in vitamin D research who has written a book, & also the site of the National Vitgamin D Council. At 9:00 am the very next day she called in the script. She had no clue about the importance of D or how to assess the numbers from the test. Apparently she did the research I had requested- thank God.

A tip for not having side effects with the high D dosage- take it with a large, fatty meal. It’s a perfect excuse to cheat & have fried foods or lots of butter without guilt. I have had no side effects by doing this (I think I read it on Cleveland Clinic or Dr. Holick’s site). Not through my regimen yet but am feeling brighter with more energy.

Just like educating my Dr., I plan to spread the word to everyone I know about the importance of D deficiency and how it also eventually leads to other serious illnesses. I live in Ohio & heaven knows we don’t get sun for a large part of the year. I am also fair skinned, so slather on the sunscreen in the summer. My body probably could never produce enough D on its own with these circumstances.

One dr. who has done many studies is calling D defiency an epidemic in this country, and unfortunately most doctors haven’t heard anything about it. It’s up to us to educate them!

I wish you all well, Ceci

After reading all your posts some people need to do a bit more research on Vitamin D dosage. There are 2 types of Vitamin D in the body. Vitamin D2 is created by the body and then gets transformed to Vitamin D3. Thi 50,000 IU of Vitamin D is Vitamin D2. This creates a high level of Vitamin D2 but gets slowly converted to D3. Vitamin D3 is what the body uses and no Doctor would ever give someone 50,000 IU of Vitamin D3. It takes months of a high level of Vitamin D3 intake to create toxic levels. So rest assured the 50,000 IU of Vitamin D2 is safe. I am being treated with 50,000 IU because I have had muscle spasm and bone pain for 8 years after I was finally diagnosed with Vitamin D Deficiency (20) I have to take it once a week and have only been doing so for 1 weeek. I did notice some severe muscle twitching, but it was in the areas that I have severe muscle spasm (trigger points). Twitching to me indicates that the D is working because the muscles are reacting to something foreign to them. Also, with any treatment, one should always give the treatment at least a month before discontinuing. We must remember that our bodies are lacking something that it needs and when our bodies get ""used"" to not having this, it will react as if it is a foreign substance and eventually our bodies will get used to the higher amount. I only gave three stars because I have just started the treatement. I will update after the treatment has completed.",193

I can remember my mom telling me that I had rickets when I was a baby and would not walk. I do not know what the treatment was at that time, but I do know she took me to the doctor. My doctor was not surprised to hear this news since I have low calcium and Vit D. My energy level increased due to the thyroid treatment. I am hoping when this calcium and Vit D gets to working, my body will be pain free. I have never had any problems taking the high dose of 50,000 mg and faithfully take it once a week until it will be gone (I have great faith in my doctor). Then I will faithfully take the others daily and be retested again. I even double checked with the office girl about this and she called me back and said I was to take the daily supplements in between the 50,000 doses. I still think I know my body and am waiting until I take the last large dose before taking the dailies.  Hope this helps!",2

First 2 came back fine, but vitamin D level was low (21).  Dr. prescribed 50,000 iu of Vitamin D once a week for 8-weeks and then get re-tested.  I've taken it for about 6-weeks now and notice a HUGE difference.  I feel like I have a normal mood and average energy (vs. being depressed all the time and low energy).  No muscle pains.  Fecal urgency still happens, though.  Overall, the effect on my mood and energy is literally life-changing.  I was nervous about taking the 50,000 units, but noticed no ill effects whatsoever... maybe episodes of slight ""loopiness"" a day or two later, sometimes.  ",9

Have been taking Rx for 18 years and it DID save my life. Got better, but still never really felt 100% at any time over the years.

I read about Vit D3 deficiency (http://www.vitamindcouncil.org) and got tested (using the correct test (25-hydroxyvitamin D test, also called a 25(OH)D ) . I was woefully deficient (28). Need to be in the 50-80 range, so started with the 2,000 IU/day and then found the 5,000 IU pill at iHerb.com (FYI: use DAH122 for $5.00 off your first order - my gift to you, :)  ) 

Since taking the Vit D3, my mood has dramatically improved - to the point that I am NOT taking any pharmaceutical Rx for depression for the first time in 18 years! I am truly amazed. Also, my overall health is better, my 'bad' cholesterol levels are dropping, no colds - not even the sniffles - since taking Vit D3. I've LOST approx. 25 pounds (read this may be due to NOT TAKING the anti-depressant). 

I will continue to take Vit D3 until I die. Absolutely remarkable results! Living in MN coupled with Scandinavian heritage, this vitamin is a MUST. I would recommend you get your Vit D3 levels checked.. and remember, if the lab you Dr. uses is Quest, then you have to multiply your results by 1.3 to get a more accurate result. Quest Labs have 'issues' and  yes, you can Google it for yourself. And don't listen to those that say a range of 30-40 is 'normal' and 'fine'. READ the results of the clinical RESEARCH, even if it is lengthy and technical.. Please don't be swayed by the pharmaceutical companies (and the FDA's)disinformation.  Take charge of YOUR life and do the research! You'll be glad you did.

The brand I use is not listed (Healthy Origins), so I just picked one.

Problems included: severe fatigue, muscle pain, severe joint swelling and pain, bone pain, ""foggy"" feeling, sinus problems, ear problems, a positive ANA test result and breathing problems.  I've tried multiple treatments through several doctors and specialists.  Switched to a new doctor and - during intake - found low Vitamin D levels.  Doctor prescribed 100,000 IU's to be taken one time each week for four weeks (to be retested following).  Initially, I experienced an increase in pain, almost like a tenderness all over my body.  However, the joint swelling, pain, sinus, and several other problems have subsided and the tenderness is getting better.  It wasn't overnight, but I am getting better.

I would highly recommend this treatment.  I know some of the prescribed levels sound scary, but it has helped me to finally experience relief after 10 years of pain...and the level I am taking is short term.  Please stay at it as best you can, I experienced relief from my symptoms and I believe that you can as well, but you'll need to stick with it.

As an aside, my doc says if my numbers check okay at the end of treatment, then I'll move to a 1,000 IU daily supplement.

The only reason I rated the ""Effectiveness"" section with 2 stars was due to the fact that I haven't completed treatment yet. I haven't noticed any changes with my symptoms, but I'm not sure if my symptoms are due to the D deficiency and I'm only half way through the prescription I was given.  I know many people are hesitant to take 50,000iu (as I was and to be truthful it still gives me pause every time I take it) and I wanted to share my experience with others who are deficient. 

From all the research I have gathered over the last several weeks of reading up on the subject of D deficiency - this is something people shouldn't take lightly.  The medical community have finally realized that D deficiency leads to a whole host of medical problems.  Vitamin D can not only provide treatment for some conditions, but actually prevent others from occurring in the first place.  I couldn't deny the facts and knew I had to take this or possibly deal with greater problems in the future as a result of depriving my body of something it vitally needs.  

One other point I wanted to mention for others who might be going through the same experience I am and that's Vitamin D deficiency and an underactive thyroid.  The information on a possible connection  between the two conditions on medical sites have been sketchy - it's alluded to in some writings, but nothing concrete is documented.  Maybe it's wishful thinking on my part that the D deficiency is the cause for the thyroid problem, but only time will tell.  My thyroid is a little underactive, but yet my thyroid antibodies test is negative for hypothyroidism.  So, again, maybe there isn't a link between the two conditions. 

I will give another update if anything new happens, if not, I will give a final entry at the end of October when I go for another set of blood tests to see if the D has increased my numbers.",65

After a month's interval, I had a strong urgency to go to the bathroom.  This is not presumed to be entirely normal, so I assumed that this was for me a normal metabolic outcome.  I then tried vitamin K2 in supplement form, which I found to lower the heart rate and blood pressure.  But after a time, about 6 weeks,  just 100mcg a day caused restless muscular reactions in my legs.  I switched to 30mcg K2/25 IU MCT Oil Base Sublingual when required.  This was a significant improvement over the supplements, and I was required to administer very judiciously just one tiny drop under the tongue.  This sublingual strategy was so that the K2 goes direct into the blood stream and not processed thru through the liver.  I probably don't require very much of either K2 or D3 noting metabolic effects with supplements such as becoming constipated or having a strong urgency to pee or restless legs, and have probably filled out my requirement.  Noted effects on stopping K2/D3 sublingual was mild heart palpitations, so I will continue in small, judicious amounts and carefully monitor.  Would recommend Boron supplements according to dosage recommendations, or perhaps Potassium Gluconate as they take far longer to fill out the basic requirement.

For the record, there are a number of companies on the web that sell in bulk, and at a level of 500mg to 1500mg, it is not only easier but MUCH cheaper to purchase in bulk and measure with measuring spoons. I just measure out 1/8 tsp (about 500mg) with breakfast and before workouts, and mix it with food, or pop it in my mouth and swallow with water. Dosing on nutritional supplements does not have to be exact, so if you vary by up to 10%, it won't make an huge difference anyway. Remember this is to supplement your body's own natural production.

When I got off of that, I started using this ginseng.  Honestly, this works better than the depo shots for me and that is no exaggeration.  My main problem is motivation...actually getting up and doing something.  It wasn't until I stopped using the ginseng that I realized how motivated I seemed to always be.  I'm not a person who takes medications or natural remedies (low T was the first time I went to a doctor in 6 years), which is why I think I didn't notice a change until I stopped using it.  Less than 2 weeks after stop using it, I had no motivation again.

I've begun using it again, but more sparingly.  This ginseng increased my blood pressure by a lot; I have always had below average blood pressure.  It got the point I couldn't sleep at night only because I could feel my heart pumping and it scared me, so I had to quit taking it.  Now, after a year, I'm going to start using it again but with less dosage.  Be aware...this stuff does work but make sure you keep an eye out for any changes in your body.

That being said, this natural remedy improves my energy levels and motivation quickly and by a lot.  I did notice that morning erections are back in full, also.  I haven't had any problems there, but since I get that effect I would think it may help those with ED problems.
