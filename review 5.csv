It is very dangerous if if it is not taken in correct does and according to how long it is active in the body. If you have heavy metals (and probably everybody do to some degree), you will move metals around in the body, maybe from a benign place to a more sensitive place (like the brain), and not be able to excrete it from the body, due to how long it is active in the body. If you suspect heavy metal poisoning (from amalgams or any other source) please read about the Andrew Cutler protocol that uses true chelators in very low doses according to it’s half life and 3 day intervals, over a good periode of time, so that it is safe. It is not difficult, it is very easy to do yourself, especially with the help of the community on Facebook:) You can find the information if you google «andy cutler success stories» and info and support a lot of good info in the Facebook group «Andy Cutler Chelation:  Safe Mercury and Heavy Metal Detox», (I don’t have any association with this protocol, other than learning from it, I just care about your safety).

I am a mid 50 year old male. I have peripheral nueropathy. I was a professional musician most of my life and my neurolgist says my pn is likely a by product of too much sex, drugs and rock n roll ;-) Seriously though, she thinks 6 (alcohol) drinks a night for 30 years with a few other things here and there is the contributing factor (I quit everything 3 years ago). 

Anyway, my feet would hurt so bad, especially at night I couldn't sleep. I was wearing special shoes. Walking was painful. I used all the lidocaine and capsaicin creams and sprays. I tried a TENS unit. My Dr put me on Gabapentin (yuck). Someone in the waiting room at the Dr. office suggested ALA.

NO BS.... I noticed a difference after the first week. 1600 mg/day. Within a month probably @ 50? improvement (I quit taking Gabapentin at this point). 3 months saw @ 90% improvement (dosage here was reduced to 1200 mg/day). 6 months @ 95? better (dosage reduced to 800mg/day).

After just over a year at a dose of 800mg/day my pn is (depending on the day) between 98%-100% gone!!!! It is summer of 2016 and I have spent a significant amount of time walking around barefoot outdoors. I can wear any shoe I want, even my footwear of choice, cowboy boots. I even got my first ever pedicure a couple weeks ago. 

You have nothing to lose, so try it, I sure hopes it does for you what it did for me.

Who asked how can you tell if ALA is working.
1) Monitor your blood sugar for a week WITHOUT the ALA.
2) Take ALA as suggested for a week and monitor your blood sugar.
See if your blood sugar has gone down or if any of your symptoms are better (though it's too early to really tell but some people actually get early results)
3) Keep taking ALA til the bottle runs out.
Check your blood sugar levels til ALA runs out. 
If A) Your blood sugar levels go down, then the ALA is working.
B) If your blood sugar doesn't go down BUT you see improvement in any of your symptoms,
continue with the ALA. Check to see how long it's safe to take ALA. Keep taking ALA for as long (length of time) as said to be safe.
Hope this helps those who want to know.

When first using it, it has a more powerful and noticeable effect, where I wake up in the morning feeling very peaceful and refreshed compared to usual. Eventually, if I keep taking it, it has a lot less of that effect. I take breaks from it for a few weeks after using it nightly for a few months to a year, because of a concern that it competes with the B-vitamin biotin, which has strong value for one's health. I take biotin every day earlier in the day away from the lipoic. I have tried using lipoic in conjunction with heavy metal detox protocols (modified citrus pectin and/or chlorella and/or cilantro in my green veggie juices, etc.) because the research behind that is, as I understand it, quite sound and convincing if done the right way. Should not be used too early in the program if one is definitely laden with mercury, because it can mobilize Hg in a way that it may bring more INTO the brain instead of removing it. For that purpose, should be used after a lot of whole body Hg detox has taken place first over a long period of time, and THEN use it every 3 hours I believe (might have been 2.5) to help remove some mercury. I confirmed higher Hg levels in urinalyses when doing this.",9

I've been taking R-Alpha Lipoic Acid, from Jarrows, for quite some time for type 2 diabetes and diabetic neuropathy.  Recently a mix-up occurred and I wasn't putting it with my daily pills.  I also use a fentanyl duragesic patch and a strong hydromorphone dose for breakthrough pain for this and other issues.  

I have a LOT of prescriptions to manage, so missing one pill is easy.  I had to take more and more hydromorphone to get any relief from my neuropathy, which was unusual, but a few hours later I'd be hurting again.  After a couple weeks I was literally starting to get desperate so we went through my pills and found the missing bottle of Alpha Lipoic Acid.  I took a couple that morning, and I was back to normal by the afternoon!

Now don't get it in your head that if you take it just when you have a neuropathy flare-up that you will get instant improvement -- maybe it helped me so fast since I took it for so long, but who knows.  I can't recommend it enough though -- strong painkillers barely helps neuropathy, but this stuff works fantastic.

I have no idea if it's true or not, but you should try and get the ""active"" version of Alpha Lipoic so that your body can use it immediately.  I use a 100 mg dose of the Jarrow R-ALA morning and evening for neuropathy, which runs me about $17 a month when I buy them from Amazon.

Seriously, try it.  Take it for a month and see if you notice your nerve pain go away.  If not, then stop taking it ... and see if you notice it then.  I sure as heck did...

Note that I can't find Jarrow Formula's on the product brand, but hopefully the one I chose is close enough.  Search Amazon for Jarrow Formulas R-Alpha Lipoic Acid and that should do it too.",5

I needed cephalexin antibiotic to clear it up along with exposure to sunshine, lavender and herb poultice applied (with chickweed, red clover and yellow dock).

It should also be taken with food for sure. Urine will smell like when you eat asparagus. Since this antioxidant is found in only a few foods, spinach, broccoli, organ meats, brewers yeast, and potatoes; none of these did I consume daily. So for me the ALA was an excellent choice.

I have been plagued by kidney stones for the past 4 years, when I was diagnosed with innumerable kidney stones in both kidneys.  In May 2018 I had surgery to remove 5 kidney stones that were embedded in my ureter.  When I went back for follow-up, I still had blood in my urine, so more tests (ultrasound, CAT scan, KUB).  Another stone; this one was 8 mm and also in my ureter.  I was not in pain, but the location of the stone was causing my kidney to enlarge, so my doctor determined it would have to be removed and scheduled my surgery for 10/23/18.  The stone had been in the same location for the previous 10 weeks, and wasn't moving at all.  The thought of going through the surgery (and the stent they insert afterwards) was enough to prompt me to start searching for any alternatives.  I came across chanca piedra.  I read so many reviews from people who claimed it worked that I figured I'd try it; I had nothing to lose except $30.  The product I bought was Stone Breaker by EU Natural (and if you are wondering, the answer is NO, I have not been paid to write this review; I've not been in contact with the company that sold it to me, and I paid full price). I took the first dose on Tuesday; taking 2 tablets twice a day.  On Sunday morning, I passed the stone.  I am still in shock.  I almost can't believe it myself.   It came out in 5 pieces, like it was literally broken up.  I know if something seems too good to be true, it usually is.  But I can state, in absolute honesty, unequivocably, that this stuff worked!

A few of the larger ones have been removed by laser and lithotripsy.   I had 4 small stones in my left kidney and one in my right remaining ranging from 3mm to about 5mm.    It was coming up to my yearly review with my doctor.  I had to have an abdominal X-ray prior to my appointment to see if the stones had grown.    So about 8 weeks prior to this I decided to try Chanca Piedra in powder form, which I mixed according to directions,  and drank as a cold tea.   I did this for two weeks. 
During the two weeks my joints ached which I felt was a side effect of the mixture and I had occasional back pain, but I was determined to see the two weeks out.   Im so glad I did, as the X-ray showed ZERO stones.  I’m thrilled to say the least!   Bear in mind that a plain X-ray is not as detailed as a scan however my doc said that if there were any stones remaining that they would be so insignificant (small) they wouldn’t be a problem.   I can recommend Chanca Piedra to anyone who would like to give complementary medicine a try before consenting to more invasive measures.   You have nothing to lose except $30 for two packets of CP.

I am 66, and was in reasonably good health and thought a liver/gallbladder cleanse would improve my health.  After drinking apple juice (4 glasses) I took 1/2 the dosage or 20 drops and I got a horrible pain in my gut, like a burning sensation. It lasted for days, now weeks and ruined my health (hopefully not permanently)and I ended up in ER. As it turned out, my gallbladder and liver were free of stones the ultra sound showed. So this cleanse was unnecessary!!!!Pan radiated to my gut and back for days due to an ulcer I had inflamed. 

Now I am taking Prilosec which has the potential for severe side effects to diminish the pain and heal. My doctor has scheduled me for a test to put a camera in my stomach with a tube down my throat to see what damage has been done and treat this type of ulcer. Please be careful.  I was one of those people who thought all herbs are safe and took things like Cayenne, Ginger, Tumeric thinking because it comes from a natural source, it must be safe. This combination of acidic foods and herbs created a perfect storm which burned my stomach, and Chanca Piedra was the catalyst. It has been very scary, painful and will take me a lot of changes in my lifestyle to heal. If it ain't broken, don't fix it and be a fool, like me.",2

I started taking the stone breaker 3 times a day and when I went back to the doctor 3 months later as that is how long it took to get in to see the doctor the xray showed nothing was there. So the doctor order another xray a cat scan this time as it is more accurate. I went today and the results were the 6mm is gone and the 9mm and 4mm that were left in the kidneys are now only a few pieces that are 2-3mm in size. This worked better than I ever thought it would as I was just hoping it would get ride of the one 6mm stuck just outside the bladder.

I think I experienced the serious negative side effects almost immediately after consumption.  I needed this product to help me detox ""toxins"" in my body -- mainly, candida and possibly mercury. I am also trying to decalcify my pineal gland. I so needed this product and wanted it to work in that I tried using it on 3 different occasions (varying the dosage)but with ultimately the same results.  Taking a lower dose, I was less sick but experienced the unpleasant side effect of nausea before the other symptoms hit.  The main unpleasant symptoms?  Repeated vomiting and severe diarrhea (coming out of both ends simultaneously -- I know, too much information).  Retching to the extent of having a sore throat the next day.  Lying supine on the bathroom floor for hours feeling intensely weak and ill.  At least, when I lowered the dose I didn't think I was going to die for the side effects and they did not last as long (3-4 hours vs 8 - 10).  My belief is that supplement worked but that my system is so riddled with ""poisons"" that the die-off (mainly of candida) was too much for my system to handle.  I experienced similar symptoms when I finished the protocol of hydrogen peroxide (food grade) therapy but that took 3 weeks to build up to the dosage that would cause the candida to ""die-off"" which of course, inundates your system with toxins and feels like (I imagine) heroin addicts must feel when they detox -- it is a living nightmare and you do feel like you may not survive it.  I wish I could tolerate the yaeyama chlorella that I took because I think it does its job, its just that the side effects are immediate and intolerable and consistently happen.

It is very important to start very slowly with the smallest dose possible and then build up the doseage.

I could see, however, experiencing some rather uncomfortable headaches and nausea if you are very toxic in your system and then slam in the Chlorella all of a sudden.

Before taking Chlorella, I took Klamath Blue-Green Algae for years. Like all algae supplements, it's very important that you get a product that isn't contaminated.

In my experience, it's the contaminated products that make people experience the harsh symptoms like nausea, vomiting, etc. As WebMD states in their own description of blue-green algae in general, ""blue-green algae products that are contaminated are LIKELY UNSAFE...Contaminated blue-green algae can cause liver damage, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, weakness, thirst, rapid heartbeat, shock, and death. Don’t use any blue-green algae product that hasn’t been tested and found free of mycrocystins and other contamination.""

I guess others who wrote about having these symptoms might just be allergic rather than hitting upon a contaminated product, but for me, I've had no problems with the Yarrow Formulas so far.

It's not a toy, though, so do follow the dosing directions. You need to build up a tolerance in your system. I didn't, and ended up having a hypglycemic reaction. Then I read that it's good for lowering blood sugar too. Wow! It sure does! I hadn't paid any attention to that because I don't have diabetes.
I don't know what the dosing instructions for the tablets say, but if they're anything like those of the powder, the people who had bad reactions may have taken too much, too early.

When I stopped for a few weeks her age-related and

thought processes and mind-body connections became
very impaired making it difficult to communicate
with her effectively and difficult for her to stand or walk a couple feet.  I started giving her
the CoQ 10 again, and it was amazing.  Within 48 hours her previous physical and mental abilities returned.  She can complete her sentences which are again coherent, she can understand what I say,
and she can stand up for 5 minutes, walk across the room and even play Scrabble with me.  Without
the CoQ 10 it had become so difficult to take care
of her at home over a 6-8 week period that I thought I would have to put her in a Care Home. 
I read that Lovastatin causes CoQ 10 deplepletion
(along with the aging process).  I was totally amazed how fast CoQ 10 worked to reverse the totally debilitating process that was getting worse and worse for my mother.  With CoQ 10 daily,

thoroughly research how one's medicines may be negatively interacting, (causing reduced or increased absorption or other side effects) and how some medicines can result vitamin and mineral

After discovering that statins like the Crestor that I take reduce CoQ10 as part of the same process it used to reduce cholesterol -- and Coq10 is needed to produce the ATP that muscles use for their energy, I tried it.  I  saw an immediate and very significant increase in strength.   Admittedly, if I had been sedentary, I probably would not have noticed a difference.   There have been trials that proved this affect, but the medical community tends to ignore them.

I am a 60 year old female, and I have been taking co-Q-10 supplements daily for over 20 years.  I began taking it after reading a research paper that indicated that co-Q-10 might be effective in increasing immune response.  My whole life prior to that time, I was extremely susceptible to infections; if someone with the flu or a cold even looked at me across a room, I got sick.  I was constantly sick as a child, and as an adult suffered what seemed like a continuous cold throughout the winter, along with episodes of the flu, bronchitis, etc.  NOTHING helped, not dietary intervention, not the then-popular vitamin C dosage, nothing.  After several months of taking a combined dose of co-Q-10, vitamin E and lecithin (a cocktail suggested in the research paper), I noticed that I was not getting sick as often.  I have continued the same dosage since that time, and I have not had a single cold while taking it.  No colds, no flu, no bronchitis, nothing. I did suspend the dosage for several weeks two or three times, to see if it made a difference.  It did.  Caught a cold.  Started dosage again and returned to cold-free status. (I should note that after reading reports earlier this year that long-term dosage with vitamin E could be harmful, I discontinued the vitamin E portion of the cocktail.  I have not noticed any decrease in effectiveness).   So I am curious to know if there have been any further studies on this effect of co-Q-10.  Is it possible that this could be a placebo effect of such lasting duration?  What say you, experts?  Inquiring minds want to know. ^_^

It could be because CLA increases lean muscle mass. And, since even at rest,a pound of muscle burns more fat than a pound of fat, increasing your lean muscle mass helps you burn more calories. So I'm burning more calories and losing more fat. I'm sure the results would be even better if I incorporated more exercise. Right now, I have been inconsistently walking around my apartment complex (1 round only) 2-3 times per week. Before CLA, walking would help me lose maybe 1 pound in a 2 week period.

Simultaneously, my depressed mood improved very significantly. Chicken or the egg?

I take 2000 mg of omega 3s in fish oil daily with fluoxetine (Prozac) and it makes a HUGE difference.  I drive much slower, I'm much more patient, and people don't aggravate me half as much.

Fish oil works by reducing inflammation in the brain on a sub-cellular level which allows the neurotransmitters in the brain to be able function more efficiently without misfiring (which is believed to be the cause of many mood disorders).

Regardless if you're suffering general anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, or any number off issues, fish oil will only help.

Be sure to read the label, just because it says 1000 mg on the bottle means very little.  What is important are how many mg of actual omega 3s are in each capsule.  Most drug store brands have about 300mg of omega 3s and to be effective for mood disorders, you need 2000-3000 mgs of omega 3s daily.  Specifically EPA.

If fish oil prevents blood clotting, ie thickening of blood,and can cause bleeding from the liver,, would taking this krill oil be causing me to lose iron? Just wanted to chime in with my theory. I think Ill stop taking it for awhile. The body doesnt need much fat. Hormones are made from chlorestorel. But think of the body as mostly water. What happens when you put oil, in water? It floats. Think of your blood. Basically, the oil is greasing up your blood. I have read studies about vit e and estrogen that state estrogen is inactive until activated by e, e is an oil. when activated by the wrong oil, it can trigger cancer. I even wonder if the body needs ANY external oils at all. This states that the omegas are not naturally made in the body. Then why supplument them?

(The article: Mol Psychiatry. 2012 Dec;17(12):1272-82. doi: 10.1038/mp.2011.100. Epub 2011 Sep 20.).

Then again, the research does indicate that omega-3s are helpful for cardiac pathology, and certainly they don't *harm* you, so I'm going to keep taking them.

Estrogen binding to the alpha receptor up regulates cell proliferation while estrogen binding to the beta receptor down regulates cell proliferation. Also only one receptor is available at a time, so a phytoestrogen binding to the beta receptor also has the effect of blocking of an endogenous estrogen from binding to the alpha receptor. As such flax (and soy) phytoestrogens are anticipated to result in a protective effect with respect to estrogen sensitive breast cancer, which corresponds to the observed correlation with reduced breast cancer with increasing soy consumption.",0

This by far is the best thing ive used for my face thus far with the exception of birth control pills (ortho-tricylcen) which seemed to keep my blemish prone skin under control. However, this is way cheaper and has other health benefits too. I occasionally will breakout near my period but even so its no where as bad as it previously was. So I would highly recommend this to anyone who is trying to get their facial ance under control as I had been for so many years.",67

Folic acid is synthetic and cheap - but it is not what the body uses.  It has to convert it to methylfolate first.

Folic Acid and 5-MTHF or (L-Methylfolate) are different substances.  I wish Web MD would not lump them together.  Folic Acid is synthetic and it likely feeds cancer cells.  Folate occurs naturally in foods.  See this blog for the explanation. http://blog.designsforhealth.com/blog/bid/115121/ Folic-Acid-vs-Folate-Part-I

I hope WEB MD clears this up.  WEB MD is a great site with only occasional  misinformation.  So WEB MD, thanks for the site.

I use Metabolic Maintenance brand, 5-MTHF, or Methylfolate, 10 mg.  This is a generic version of the medical food Deplin.  Read the reviews for Deplin on Web MD.

I purchase pure GABA in bulk online, with no other ingredients. I dissolve the powder in water and take it by mouth an hour before bed. 

Subjectively, I feel very relaxed. There is pain relief in my lower back. I find it very easy to fall asleep, within 15 minutes, as most nights I toss/turn for about 30 minutes to an hour.

I am less anxious during the day. I'm not sure if this is because I've been sleeping better, or because of the GABA itself.

Some side effects I experience are shortness of breath and an itching sensation similar to when I take Niacin. Both of these subside within 10 to 20 minutes.

With better sleep and a general state of calm throughout my day, I would recommend GABA.

I've heard some skeptical people claim that GABA does not work because it cannot cross the BBB (Blood Brain Barrier). I cannot overlook my experience and results for their theories, and neither should you.

I have no words to describe how thankful I am that I have found this combination because I feel calm, relaxed and in control of all of my problems now.

I think the problem is that I was taking 2 capsules in the morning and 1-2 at night.

I had to learn not to take too much GABA because it does relax all your muscles including your breathing which can be very disconcerting. It has replaced the prescription meds and truly helps the spasms ease off. The other day the Dystonia flared up and I couldn't turn my neck to the left because the muscles had tightened so hard on the right.  I took a strong dose of GABA and within an hour I could feel the muscles start to loosen up and I took another dose a couple of hours later and then could start to turn my head to the left again. I have been taking GABA since 2007, 6 years, and I can go without taking it when the Dystonia isn't acting up and suffer no withdrawal effects.  You need to learn how to take it so that you find your theraputic dose without impacting your breathing or the tingling in your face.  If you feel those effects you have taken too much. I've also noticed that if I take a dose on an empty stomach you will feel the effects of the GABA more quickly and stronger.  If you've eaten you may need to take a little more GABA to get the muscle relaxing affect.

I've started getting heartburn attacks and constant acid reflux (constant feeling of needing to burp, acid coming up my throat when I do burp, feeling of lump in my throat). I can't say for sure if it was the raw garlic, but it really did not suit my digestive system. My digestive system may have been a bit off anyway and the raw garlic acted as a catalyst in making it worse. But I found a research article online that showed ingestion of raw garlic causes stomach ulcers in dogs 100% of the time! And in humans there have been cases of it causing stomach ulcers and bleeding. I would never have taken the raw garlic if I knew it could do that. I wish I'd read some proper warnings before consuming the garlic rather than all this stuff saying it could only do good. I'm just hoping my digestive system goes back to normal soon...",19

Leave this on for up to 12 hours (overnight may prove to be long enough).  If you're first layer of tape is absorbent from the outside in to the skin, you can cover it with another piece of regular tape that will block the garlic juice from getting through the medical tape to protect healthy skin, just don't forget to punch a hole in that layer too before applying the bandaid.  The reason you want medical tape as first layer against skin is that it won't injure skin, which can't be guaranteed with a regular plastic tape, not knowing what chemicals were used on the sticky side.   After wearing the garlic bandaid for prescribed time, let the wart heal up for several days. If it shows any signs of coming back reapply the crushed garlic.

One thing I *suspect* GB has done is to reduce the severity of a poison ivy rash. I get it late EVERY winter, and this year was no different...except in the severity. I still have the rash and redness all over my arms and some on my legs. However, there are no oozing, weeping blisters.

Last year, it was so bad that it went deeper than the skin and ate into my flesh in one spot...leaving a scar that's still there today. This year, it itches very little, the rash isn't very raised, and as I said, absolutely no blisters.

I'm wondering, because the GB plant can cause an allergic skin reaction, much like poison ivy...is it possible that ingesting the supplement has helped my body counteract the effects of poison ivy?",4

All those claiming this product, Green Coffee beans or extract have also made major changes to their life.
How do you know if it is the beans which are working or the fact you are now exercising, eating more healthy food etc?
The odds are if you have changed your diet and are exercising you would lose wight without the need for the Green Coffee Beans.  Therefore I cannot state that any of the reviews have been helpful.",0

 There is always a trick in everything you order especially in FINE print that 3 out 10 people will read but not understand it.

Do NOT try it if you dont have the time for exercise, proper dieting etc. and remembering to make that call to CANCEL before their 14 day free trial period with a review of the product. Lesson learned!!!
 After that, when you call customer care line they will ask for you to either ship it back (out of your pcket) with tracking # and confirmation before you get full refund, (That's only IF product is unopened) before you get total refund or lose out on $20, to keep product and then returning $58 back into your account 3-5 business days.

1. If you have lots of lbs to loose then you will be loosing fast at forst, no matter what kind of diet you are on  or pill. Its just how it works. 
2. If you have 5-15 lbs to loose pills wont really help or even if they do, it will take you longer before you see any results ( if any)
2.Dont take this pill before dinner. You wont be able to sleep.( my bottle specifically says to take them before breakfast and lunch)
4.Dont take with milk or milk products. Mlik proteins innhibit absorprtion of ployphenols in green coffee.
4. if it hurts your stomach , take it with food ( also on my bottle)
5. Healthy eating and excerise def. will benefit you. You wont see any results if you sit on the couch and eat potato chips.
6. Last, but not least EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT. There is no pill that will provide the same result for everyone.
Good luck everyone...",45

We use the explosive powder for our improvised toy pistols. I was operated for this after 2 years, since not all glass splinters were taken out in the emergency room.

Two of my surgical wounds got infected and my mom was treating them with “sulfanilamide”, but the wound have not healed after 2 weeks and were becoming bigger. Alarmed, my cousin boiled guava leaves and used the solution to wash and clean my infection. It healed in less than 3 days. Boiled guava leaves solution is a traditional wound treatment of old folks in Philippine provinces. 

I now take guava leaves tea ever since I read all the positive reviews for its efficacy in treating different kinds of illness. I also told my son to take a glass everyday which somehow relieved his recurring gastritis. I also asked my wife to do so, since she came from a family with high tendency to diabetes; but there was a side effect: She feels dizzy and has had nape pain even after taking only half glass of guava leaves tea. I told her to totally stop taking it.

By the way, I have a not so serious facial dystonia which is now only discernable when I talk. Previously I can’t even have a good ID picture. I don’t know if guava tea leaves helped.

Hope you find my review helpful.

Warm regards,

I am a chronic alcoholic.I went from being a social drinker until 2001 then turned into a daily drinker drinking 2-3 shots of Grand Mariner per day. I would start drinking in the evening after all chores were done and kids were in bed, around 9pm. Fast forward 16 years. I am now at 8+ shots per day beginning when I get home from work at 5:30pm. What time do I go to bed now? I have no idea because I've been blacking out for the past 6 years. How many times have I tried to quit? More than I can remember. 
After doing almost daily searching for ways to cut back or quit drinking I stumbled upon KUDUZ herbal supplement and this has been a God send for me!
Cravings? Completely gone! The thought/craving that used to consume me is gone! 
This is the first time in 18 years that I know I am going to make it. I know I can do this. I don't know why this supplement isn't better known because I've had the want to quit for a long time, just not the willpower.
I am finally getting my life back!

However, liver and blood readings said otherwise, and I knew I had to cut back and/or stop.  After a few weeks of religious use of high-quality brand...wow.  I don't feel any urge to drink, or more importantly, carry on after one drink.  One thing I'd say is don't think it will immediately take urges away.  It just makes the actual drinking part unfulfilling.  If you are a trained wine taster like me, this is a godsend because I can still taste, enjoy with food, and not even think about having to control when or how much.  It just eliminates that element.  Keep taking it and don't give up because maybe for some like me, it was just more subtle and over a bit of time.

Yesterday I woke up and went about my day. Usually the first thing that enters my mind is What time am I going to have a drink today. But for some reason it didn't. I drove past my first bottle shop and thought, don't feel like one yet. That happened all day until 7pm came. I was relaxed and thought, I don't really feel like it tonight. Today no drink again and I'm not fazed. It's late at night, I'm relaxed and my mind seems occupied and I really don't want or have any urge what so ever. I suppose you have to want to stop.

I’ve decided to write a daily journal to track my progress while taking the Kudzu herbal supplement.  To recap, I started taking the Kudzu about a week and a half ago but not consistently.  I did notice a difference in my response to alcohol since I started taking it, it’s difficult to explain, but my need to continuously put a drink up to my lips was not there.  I still over drank two of the days but it seemed to take a lot longer to get to the point of irrationality where I compulsively keep drinking.  Also, the buzz effect I get sometimes even after one drink was not there.  I didn’t take the Kudzu consistently, even missed days, so I’m hoping to test these next two weeks taking it as they say, 2 pills after breakfast, 2 pills after lunch.  I took it yesterday and I have noticed one of the side effects is that I don’t digest meals as quickly.  It’s not quite heartburn, but like the food sits in your stomach.  I had trouble sleeping and had stomach cramps because I had to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night.  I’m hoping this isn’t regular.  I’m going to try to eat lighter at night to help alleviate.
3 weeks - Tuesday May 15th. It has been three weeks since I started taking Kudzu.  The good news is I've only over drank 3 times, which might sound like a lot but is good for me.  I've drank at cookouts, dinner, home, and a soccer game and can honestly say that the urge to overdrink was greatly diminished.  I have not been as consistent as I'd like taking the 2 pills after meals twice a day but the effects still remained.  The only real side effect I have felt is indigestion, gas and a bloated feeling, like I'm not digesting.  But I have been taking some Gas-ex and that seems to do the trick.  I'm going to keep taking it for the next two weeks and see how my drinking is affected.  It is not a magic pill, you still make the choice to drink or over drink, but I can honestly say it has changed the ""need"" to keep putting a drink to your lips.",170

It's effective in reducing the urge to drink, and if you can make it past the first couple of days, it's smooth sailing, but you must keep using it.  You are going to feel different, at first, and many will contribute this to the Kudzu itself, but in reality you've just removed an energy source -- alcohol; not a good energy source, as your body uses alcohol first for energy, carbohydrates second, followed by protein.  So if you're drinking and wondering why you're gaining weight, that would be why.  Another tip, while I'm here.. stay AWAY from sugar.  Alcohol and sugar feed the same receptors.  That's why you'll see tons of sugary treats at AA meetings.  Give up sugar and alcohol, let Kudzu feed your brain, and you're good to go.  Good luck everyone.",184

So started taking L-Argine Plus by Elements with 5010mg of l-argine and 1010mg of l-citruline once a day and BP has stayed in the 115 to 125 range. I was able to ween myself off the amlodipine but not the valsartan.  Was shocked to find that no one has done enough research on the use of nitrous oxide to lower BP and use it for High BP therapy...it's not expensive but you know how some physicians can get.  My dentist is checking with her other fellow dentites to see if they have noticed this.  Bottom line is it works for me.,15

I learned that a combination of l-arginine and aged garlic would take care of high blood pressure as well and I decided to try it. I started taking both about 3 weeks ago and the results have been great. My blood pressure now fluctuates between 120 and 130 systolic and 60 to 68 dyastolic - which is great for a 72 year old like myself. I like the fact that this a natural approach to controlling my blood pressure and I no longer have to use a precription drug to do it. I'm achieving these numbers with only 500 mg. of arginine a day. You can up your daily intake til you reach your goal. And although I don't have an ED issue it's a nice benefit to boot.,2

I didn't have depression, anxiety, or any mood disorder; apart from the hair-pulling, I was completely healthy. After stopping Abilify cold-turkey (my doctor at the time told me this would be okay; she was WAY wrong), I experienced an intense 5-day-long anxiety attack.  Just constant panic, depression, crying, and depersonalization. On day 5, the ""episode"" ended just as suddenly as it began.

Ever since then, I'd have weeks of normalcy--even a slight euphoria--and then about 3 days of anxiety and depression that would, again, start without warning, and end just as suddenly.  Sometimes it was 3 days, sometimes more; sometimes it was so bad I couldn't function. Some episodes were more mild, but still very disrupting my life. I also began to pull more hair than ever.

I saw many doctors and was diagnosed with everything from General Anxiety, to Postpartum Depression (I gave birth a year ago), to Bipolar disorder. I knew in my heart the Abilify had caused this, somehow.

I read in a few forums about people having great success with TwinLab Amino Fuel, L-glutamine powder, and magnesium (all three taken together in the mornings on an empty stomach--I take 40 mL, 1 teaspoon, and 250 mg, respectively). I decided to give it a try, since I was desperate, and Abilify had scared me off psychiatric drugs permanently.

Within a week, I felt a LOT better. I started taking another 250 mg magnesium before bed, and now (2 months later) I feel even better, almost 100%. I do get ""twinges"" of anxiety now and then, but they are so mild and fleeting, I barely notice them; on these days I take an extra magnesium midday. I know the other supplements are helping a lot too, but the magnesium is great just by itself. It feels like I have my life back!! Highly recommend no matter what kind of anxiety you have.",73

It comes in a few different flavors (all natural), and it can be found at Whole Foods stores.  I mix a heaping tablespoon with a glass of water.  It is a relaxing, anti-stress drink, which I take at night (about 30-60 min. before bedtime),and it has helped me greatly in a number of ways:  Helps me to RELAX and SLEEP (I had been plagued with insomnia for years!), AND helps with REGULARITY (bowel movements, as I had also suffered with constipation my whole life).  I was diagnosed w/Fibromyalgia back in the early 1980's, and have tried so many different Rx's over the years, but would end up with unwanted side-effects from each med.  Now, I don't take any Rx meds, just the Natural Calm, plus have changed my diet, which has made a HUGE improvement!  If you're not familiar w/the Paleo diet, you would do yourself an unbelievable favor by checking into it.  It's basically eating REAL food, and eliminating all grains, sugars, and processed ""foods"".  Not only did it help with weight loss, but I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER in so many ways!  Less fatigue, more mental clarity, less fibro-pain, etc.  God bless each of you, in your quest to feel better and become a healthier individual!  :) ",88

Gradually increase the doses until you reach the peak of diarrhea; then back the dosing down until it subsides. Stay on that does awhile and if needed, try taking the dose up gradually again.  I take a 1,000 mg twice a day and it helps with feeling less stressed as well.

IT WORKS.

But Big Pharma cannot control it, so therefore it is ""POSSIBLY SAFE"".

What a crock.

Indians have used it FOR CENTURIES.

'Big Pharma' RUINED my heart. 2 med' were mixed by a doctor who SHOULD NOT BE PRACTICING - 20+ Malpractice suits pending - but he goes on and on.

I got  antibiotic colitis, was told ""it was all my head"", and ended up with persistent atrial fibrillation. I pro-tennis athlete with ZERO heart history.

Long story short, segue 6 years LATER when I was FINALLY ably to receive treatment. My Ejection Fraction was down to 27/28%!!!

They asked if I could GET OUT OF A CHAIR, UNAIDED! I still had to work, teach, and play tennis LIKE THIS!

The cutoff for an Ablation (I wanted to start simple - not MAZE, Pacemaker, etc) was an E/F of 35%.

The surgeon told me there was ""no way"" to raise my E/F.

Started researching, and discovered a heart study with Pycnogenol.

45 days later, final Echo.

36%.

A 30% INCREASE.

Numbness? Tingling? At night, laying down?

Mine was increasing DESPITE a very successful Ablation.

Restarted Pyc', 3 x 360mg, spread out through the day.

Numbness and tingling (and right foot being colder) have dissipated to almost nothing.

My doctors are like 'ho hum', or ""hmmmmm"", but since THERE IS NO KICKBACK AS THERE IS IN ALL THE HIGH-END PHARMACEUTICALS?

You won't EVER hear about it.

Which is also why Big Pharma wants to make most 'alternative' (read: NATURAL) medicine ILLEGAL.

Trust me; If they can ban this stuff? It will come back, on TV, with a catchy little tune...PYTESTOLLLLLLL....la la la....

At $500+ a month.

Pricks.

Start reporting FACT.

It took me about a month of being miserable, a trip to my allergy doctor, and tons of blood work to realize that the serum was making my allergies WAY worse. The primary adverse reaction that I had was dry mouth and subtle swelling of my tongue, which was very scary.

However, a year ago I began experiencing issues with peripheral vascular disease associated with varicose veins (ulcerations and subcutaneous bleeding on my calves, joint pain and stiffness, planar fasciitis and chronic leg cramps). 

Within weeks of treating my varicose veins with compression stockings and elevation, I noted increased postural tachycardia, which became debilitating after 3 months (could no longer work). While waiting to see my PCP, I came off the melatonin and both my tachycardia and varicose veins began improving significantly. Three weeks after discontinuing its use, the tachycardia disappeared and the varicose veins improved enough to allow me to go without compressions stockings for intervals of several hours.

Have found nothing to explain the correlation but for a study in European Journal of Phramocology, vol 345, 1 March 1998 (NIH medical journal database), where the authors discuss the presence of MT1 & MT2 receptors (to which melatonin binds) in smooth muscle of vascular tissue and their role in vasodilation and constriction, respectively, as an explanation for melatonin’s systemic efficacy.

While my overall condition improved when I discontinued use, I did experience a brief period of cognitive impairment and an uptick in mean blood pressure, the latter of which may require me to seek treatment should it persist. Finally have a follow-up with a cardiologist.

But the problem is, each brand and dose of melatonin (and possibly each ""batch"") is SO different. A few brands have worked consistently better than prescription sleep aids for me, but unfortunately MOST brands are either ineffective, or produce the opposite effect desired (eg, I needed a Xanax to counteract the nervous, gittery feelings, then I still couldn't sleep but at least I wasn't jittery.)

One 3mg brand I like is pretty consistent for me (and $3/month! cheap!), but the same brand has a few other doses, plus a ""dissolvable"" 3mg dose with sweetening added, and of course all the bottles look the same, so I've accidentally bought the wrong ones (or if the right ones were sold out, tried another dose): ALL the other doses of the ""good brand"" didn't work. And the sugary one gave me the ""nervousness"" effect.

After a few YEARS of trying melatonin for sleep (on and off), though I have a decent one now, I really think the FDA should be looking at what these vitamin companies put into these pills. At least there should be consistency from ""batch to batch"" (same brand/dose).

So when you hit luck with a good one, it's very effective. But it really feels like a crapshoot when you open the next bottle. I'd love to put my brand/dose as 5-star satisfaction, but since this review is just ""melatonin"", I've got to consider the rest of my experiences with melatonin. Mostly positive, but even the few times I've gotten ""the jitters"" ...why package and sell a sleep aid that makes insomnia a nightmare?

I like that it is not addictive. I particularly like it when my schedule is irregular and I need to get to bed earlier than normal for an early am appointment. It gets you sleepy in about 20 mins. (of course it's best to start settling down for the evening). It is a dream enhancer though, the higher the dose as in 5-10mg the more one will tend to dream. This can make one feel as though they haven't slept. Best to start with a small dose and increase until you find a dosage that makes you sleepy in the 20 min range. Then go to bed. If you don't your body will just work it through and it will do no good. I also like to combine this with Valerian root which produces a sound sleep. Also non addictive. One of each on any given work night is about the right dose for me.  The melatonin dose is 1mg and the valerian is 500 mg.  I have taken up to 10 mg of melatonin with no ill effects, however you will need 8-11 hours of sleep with that dosage and you may still wake up groggy. I have also taken up to 2000 mg of valerian root with no ill effects and no grogginess (in case you have never taken valerian root it smells like dirty socks, really dirty socks lol).  Both products are relatively inexpensive. My size is 5'4"" and I weight around 145-150. Judge your dosage according to your size. I have used nearly all makes and models of both products",13

Added 50 mg Bendryl (diphenhydramine)per night a few years ago and have not needed to change either dose since. I sleep through the night and wake up refreshed but sometimes a bit groggy. A good cardio workout takes care of that. Very important - try cutting down, or better, eliminating caffeine. 
I've tried a number of brands of melatonin, but many don't work. I've settled on Natrol, because it works. There are probably others that work also, but I haven't seen any reason to experiment unless/until the Natrol becomes unavailable or stops working. Remember that these are not manufactured as drugs and there is no required test for what's in the tablet. If the first brand doesn't work for  you, try others until you find one. That doesn't mean you will necessarily succeed - melatonin doesn't work for everybody. Try it, though. Start with low doses and adjust as you see how it affects you. Good luck!",54

Rather than put me to sleep it woke me up and gave me moe energy in the first few hours after taking it each night my dreams or rather My nightmares were much much more vivid  and memorable, before this i cannot remember having or at least remembering any dreams in the last 6 months. When I did sleep, every third day or so, my sleep was much shorter topping out between 3 and  hours. Then for the 2 days after I stopped taking it I slept about 21 hours a day and was extremely groggy when I was awake (afterwards, that is after the 2 day snooze fest, I returned to my normal insomnia problems.)But the worst side effect, reportedto me by family and coworker, was that while I kept taking the melatonin I was extremely irritable, easily annoyed and angered, not to mention so energized and thinking and talking a mile a minute most of the time when I had to be really alert for work, I guess to compensate my groginess (a sort of adrenaline rush of some kind and I imagine it was like some people feel when on speed or something, or immediately after coming off of it. It got so bad at one point that I was suspended for three days from my management job because I scared an employee and maybe even a few. Which is the exact opposite of what people usually tell me, i.e. I am usually so patient, happy, understanding, forgiving and helpfull.    Anyway, that was my experience of it.

3260,56,4/28/2014 9:01:30 PM,Benzodiazepine withdrawal,"John shepherd, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months",3,5,3,"Benzodiazepines cause tolerance and physical dependence within two to four weeks, and, upon cessation acute withdrawal traditionally requires tapered management. Additionally in some long term users experience withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal syndrome can last many months and is typified by a major depressive episode, agitation, and lack of ability to get to sleep. This is a serious side effect which needs careful monitoring.
ol
For this reason Benzodiazepines need to be used with extreme caution and for very short periods.

Melatonin is effective for sleep disturbances that are not caused by an over active nervous system, such is in the case of Benzodiazepine withdrawal. It appears virtually ineffective during acute (tapered) withdrawal, although somewhat helpful during withdrawal syndrome. For this reason it's main purpose during withdrawal is an adjunct with other therapies.

To my knowledge Melatonin does not effect the calcium channels that have been disturbed by benzodiazepine usage and this is why, in my view, Melatonin is not very effective on it's own as an Anxiolytic (antianxiety agent.)

My experience is that SSRI's are not very effective for use for withdrawal, however responses to SSRI's are individual dependant.

It is essential to manage benzodiazepine withdrawal and protracted withdrawal syndrome using a variety of methods including CBT, but most effectively, using an alternative Anxiolytic, the most effective of which is Phenibut (CALMEXA).

Phenibut Calmexa is GABA with a phenyl ring that allows it to pass the blood brain barrier, therefore replacing the GABA depleted by benzodiazepine dependence. With medical management it can safely and entirely replace the use of Benzodiazepines, causing an alternative dependence both easier to taper with less risk of protracted withdrawal syndrome. 

Melatonin used together with Phenibut is very effective for inducing sleep, establishing and maintaining a sleeping pattern.

One doc in the er came back after giving pain shot and was shocked I was still awake saying I gave you enough to knock out a horse. He had not seen that high tolerance before.
I was unable to use my cpap correctly because I was tossing and turning in pain or discomfort in finding a comfortable sleep position and waking up because of the apnea.   I have had  chronic insomnia for over 20 years tried everything including prescription meds. Tried melatonin appropriate 2 months ago. Been able to get at least 4 to 5 straight hours of sleep. Wake up not drowsy and feeling more rested than I have in years. From a chronic pain and insomnia suffered this gives me hope. I use to be so tired during the day from restless night. I know there was strain on my heart and body due to constant lack of sleep. Now I can use the cpap with the goal of reaching 6 to 8 hours.

Trouble falling and staying asleep. Erratic work schedule. I use melatonin infrequently but with extremely high doses (ie used 20mg last night). Result: vivid dreams, but it helps to keep me asleep.

I'm reviewing just to let people know that this dosage is safe for me (I feel well rested, still tired but not wired, not irritable). The dreams are to be looked out for, like I said extremely vivid especially the first couple times using melatonin.
The diagnose of fibro should convey to readers that I have experienced chronic physiological (specifically muscular and nervous system) arousal for prolonged periods of time (10-15 years) due to environmental and emotional stress & poor cultural/familial support for stress resolution. Worst instance of emotional stress from 9-22 years old. It has not been fun.

Taking 5mg didn't kick in until an hour had passed, but I would wake up almost every hour afterwards. Those moments of being awake were met with distorted vision/mild hallucinations. Every wake felt like a power nap, and I'd force myself to sleep again. 

The hallucinations involved watery vision, where everything resembled liquid waves, and complete distortion of light. I've only experienced something similar in my childhood during a shroom trip. As far as I know I'm the only person in my circle to ever experience this melatonin trip effect, and unlike the shrooms it was nonstimulant and basically I thought I was going crazy. 

Upped the dose to 10mg the next night just to test, and it was identical, no more or less crazy.

I suppose this works for some people, but I really can't handle whatever it is doing to my mind or body. Like I said before tho, I must be a super rare case.",11

I take 3mg of melatonin approximately mid-day to advance my sleep phase.  The timing needs to be precise in relationship to my internal body clock, which is not always easy to know.  If I wake after an hour of heavy dream sleep, my waking time is a reliable marker and I will take melatonin eight hours later.  If I hit the right timing window, I'll have fairly strong fatigue within an hour.  This lasts for a couple of hours.  I can't do certain kinds of work in this state, but I can do housework and listen to lectures.  I call it my stupid pill, but it doesn't actually make me stupid, but impairs my ability to generate outward focus.  Missing my window even once can make it hard to recover the required timing accuracy.  The difference is profound.  I can tell I miss the window because I have far less fatigue.  Taking coffee at the same time as the melatonin significantly reduces fatigue, but it also made the treatment less reliable.  Used to have an ""all nighter"" without fail at least once every three weeks for twenty years.  In my first year on melatonin, I lost control only three times and had to flip over.  Variability in the potency messed me up on one of those.  One vendor didn't work at all.  Another vendor works well most of the time, but some bottles aren't all there.  Think I get mild stomach irritation at night, nothing really to complain about, and it could be other things in the pill.  My life is spectacularly better since I discover this, having found the research myself.  Would love to find a 100% consistent formulation.

Melatonin as mentioned does not keep her asleep all night (which isn't a problem for us). There is no drowsiness in the morning, in fact she is much less cranky and refreshed. I can't say how thankful for this product I am!

I have had close calls, a few perhaps mini-tia's, but as said previously, compared to having monthly tia's, I can deal with this.  As it still is not approved by the FDA (I so wish they would do testing for it), my doctors take it casually.  One doctor would not see me, another does accept it.  However, I know it helps.  
One note of caution:  Do be very careful with your vitamin K intake because natto will not be absorbed if too much is taken in.  All dark, leafy vegetables.  I was taking a protein supplement which did not state it contained high amounts of vitamin K and that is when I had a close call.  Also, do be sure you are buying high grade natto and with the vitamin K removed. The top grade ones can be bought through the internet vitamin stores, I use NutriCology.

My father took it for a month and his liver functions and his sugar levels went back to normal. His doctors did not understand how this was possible. 

I watched my father personally heal from this. My mother has Lupus and takes Chemo Therapy. She was drained and had no energy daily. She was dragging her feet.

My father kept pushing me to buy her the real Noni. Let me tell you, my mother within 2 weeks has went from weak to now a lady full of energy. None the less, it takes a fighter to keep up with people who are not sick, but she's improved and I will say its because of this Noni product I had no belief in at one point.

I use it for three reasons. Attention Deficit Disorder, Migraine Headaches, and for energy production. It has had ZERO side effects and has never caused any type of discomfort or health concern unlike prescription drugs. The most common problem I have found with people is that they do not give it enough time to work. Many people try the minimal dose for 30 days and don't see immediate results so they give up. It can take up to 90 days to see results. You have to give it the full 90 days. Do not buy GNC branded noni, dried noni in any form, or Hawaiian noni. I tried all of them with no results. The only product that works is made by Morinda previously Tahitian Noni. For around 13 years I took Tahitian Noni in the big green 1 liter bottles. Now I take Morinda Adaptogenics Thrive Max Concentrate which is a blend of Noni, Sour Cherry and fruit juice. It works as well if not better than the previous product.

If you have sinus pain taking 1 or 2 500mgs caps of bromelain on empty stomach does the trick. Olive leaf is nondrowzy . Bromelain could make you a little drowsy but when taken together with OL seem to have no side effects. Somebody needs to make gummys out of this stuff! Supplements are great.

Sometimes I´d catch cold and have it either during it and sometimes just post-viral cough that would last for months, and sometimes my cough would trigger off during hours of stress or tension. In my case it used to be so relentless that even a cortisone would cause a minor relief, as opposed to going away completely.

Then my elder brother looked up online and found onion as a recommended remedy. To be very honest I was very skeptical of it given how many popular and centuries remedies such as ginger, turmeric or even honey had had zero effect so far.

So my brother asked my mom to dip an onion in half a glass water (it forms a very basic part the Pakistani kitchen) and after a few hours I began taking it spoon by spoon and it worked like magic. Wow, I´ll never forget that day and the immediate relief that it provided! We´d dip it overnight and I´d take it the following day for 10-12 days and the cough cured completely as I´m off it now.

On my way, I discovered how wonderfully it works even on intestinal inflammation, although I´m yet to find it being listed online as one of its benefits. No, I´m not a patient of inflammatory bowel disease, but I do have IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) and some food often cause me intestinal inflammation. So I now occasionally use it to counter that, and it is great for IBS anyway. It just can´t be made a part of the daily routine though due to the bad breath that it gives.

So, whereas it immediately helped me with my cough, through my experience I discovered two more benefits of it and I thought I must state it somewhere online as a reference for others. Turmeric too works great for intestinal inflammatiom but I can´t take that for the mysterious insomnia that it causes me each time I take that. So I´m pleased to have come to discovered about the medical benefits that I can draw from onions.",12

Its medical value is incidental, I believe, to the joy of drinking it. High quality Oolong tea can be re-steeped numerous times, up to five or six. The caffeine in the tea is extracted through the first steeping so you aren't going to be inundating your body with caffeine if you drink it correctly. I would never go with a tea-bag version. Buy loose leaf with a nice sized tea steeper and steep at around 200 degrees Fahrenheit (not boiling though you can see the little bubbles on the sides of the glass.

Some Oolong varietals that I highly recommend (for their taste, mainly)--Dragon Oolong, Milk Oolong, Iron Goddess Ooling and so many more. 

As a note, I have both anxiety and panic disorders and I don't find the amount of caffeine in the tea to aggravate my symptoms, though it does wake me up and improve cognitive function (at least from a subjective viewpoint). Also, it curbs cravings for me. I don't even think about food. I think this is as much about the satisfying mouthfeel as it is about the caffeine. 

Obviously, if you are intolerant to caffeine, you should not drink the first steeping. While I would still talk to my doctor before doing this, I have had customers with caffeine problems steep out the caffeine, pour out the first glass (or better yet share it) and then drink five more steepings.

When I got off of that, I started using this ginseng.  Honestly, this works better than the depo shots for me and that is no exaggeration.  My main problem is motivation...actually getting up and doing something.  It wasn't until I stopped using the ginseng that I realized how motivated I seemed to always be.  I'm not a person who takes medications or natural remedies (low T was the first time I went to a doctor in 6 years), which is why I think I didn't notice a change until I stopped using it.  Less than 2 weeks after stop using it, I had no motivation again.

I've begun using it again, but more sparingly.  This ginseng increased my blood pressure by a lot; I have always had below average blood pressure.  It got the point I couldn't sleep at night only because I could feel my heart pumping and it scared me, so I had to quit taking it.  Now, after a year, I'm going to start using it again but with less dosage.  Be aware...this stuff does work but make sure you keep an eye out for any changes in your body.

That being said, this natural remedy improves my energy levels and motivation quickly and by a lot.  I did notice that morning erections are back in full, also.  I haven't had any problems there, but since I get that effect I would think it may help those with ED problems.

The last time I had my blood flow checked after using the pomegranate juice for a cpl years the artery they stented had less blood flow than the one they did nothing to...lol  I whole heartedly recommend pomegranate juice for clogged arteries.  I also take magnesium, folic acid, B3, D3 and cayenne pills.

Anyone taking those drugs should read the side effects.  I was weak and fatigued all the time on them.  Since I read up and began self medicating I feel I have been rejuvenated.  I would recommend pomegranate and cayenne pills to anyone experiencing clogged artery's.  The other things are for heart health. Recently I have also began using tart cherry juice as it also is an excellent inflammation fighter.  Inflammation is the root cause of 90% of the ailments we as humans experience and pomegranate juice and tart cherry are two of the best inflammation fighters out there.  Both are excellent anti-oxidants!  Cayenne is an excellent plaque remover.  The first three years after my heart attack I took it daily (3 times) and then moved to once a week.  Back then when I experienced chest pain I would again take it daily and within a week I was fine.

I lost a bunch of weight 5 years ago eating brown rice prepared by my dad during high school. When I went off to college, I couldn't keep up the same diet and so gained back a lot of weight. Now that I graduated and living at home, I wanted to eat brown rice again but my dad decided that red rice was better for me because he knew people back in China that ate red rice to lower cholesterol. So, every morning, I grab my lunch box of red rice and cooked veggies and lean meat to work. The first day, I ate the whole box. It would've been tasteless if my dad didn't add a little chicken stock and veggie/meat sauce to the rice. The 3rd day up to the 10th (last day, today) was where I ran into problems. It wasn't that I'm unable to stick to the diet or that I lacked the will power but half-way into the meal, I had the sudden urge to run to the bathroom. For the rest of the work day, I experienced a very bad bloating in the abdominal region and became dizzy and hot for the next 5 working hours. Today, I ate a small sandwich for lunch instead and ate my red rice meal at 5 PM. I felt great and energetic up until 5. So, I thought I'm at such an unhealthy state of being that I would feel like crap around 12 PM everyday that I never suspected the red rice. At 5 PM, approximately 5 bites in, I had to run to the bathroom with-quite frankly- a bad case of the poops. During the entire drive with my brother, I was so dizzy that I threw up a little. Fed up, I google searched about any side effects to this new lifestyle that I'm engaging myself in and came across WebMD which did explain the same side effects that I was having. Whew!

So just a warning: don't eat red rice religiously because there are side effects of dizziness (sometimes severe), immediate diarrhea, and raised body temperature. These effects can last for several hours.",0

I take 50mg WITH my meals - not before or after, to prevent migraines. I balance this with a morning and dinner time multi-vit with B complex. My chemistry is a little more sensitive in the afternoon, so I can feel fatigued dependent upon too many ""bad"" food ingredients, but not a migraine. My migraines that B2 fixes are food ingredient caused migraines. Many ingredients are industrial processed, used in most foods today and using a migraine prescription med is not safe everyday, and causes rebound migraines. As someone else said, B2 clears quickly, so multiple X per day might be good for others. I learned, for me, it works only when taken with the meal that can have ingredients I don't tolerate. 20 yrs ago I tried this, starting with a 50mg pill in the morning. I thought I would have to go to the emergency room, as it felt like I drank 50 cups of coffee. It cleared before I went, but never tried it again, wondering how others could take 400mg.

I would urge anyone who takes large amounts of one particular B vitamin to also take a good B-complex, as all B-vitamins need to work together. High levels of just Riboflavin used for a prolonged period of time can lead to cataracts. Butterbur works well, as does Feverfew. My research and personal experience shows that some people do not tolerate B-vitamins that are not methylated. Malabsorption of B2, B6, B9 and B12 can lead to high homocysteine levels in the body, which become toxic and are responsible for migraines and other unpleasant conditions. Google ""methylated B vitamins,"" and see that the inability of a person to methylate their B6, B9 and B12 can be genetic and run in families. Luckily, it is possible nowadays to find B-vitamin complexes in which those components are already methylated for us. It is advisable for people with these genetic markers to stop taking vitamin B complexes that contain unmethylated B6, B9, and B12, as it will destroy the delicate new balance. With this regime, which does include Riboflavin, I am not only keeping migraines at bay, but have stopped having food and environmental allergies (PABA works for the latter) and my digestion is much improved.",46

Most reviewers here and on Amazon take 400 mg a day. I say start small. I take 200 mg (2 pills) a day on first break with FOOD. Food prevents upset stomach associated with taking vitamins. I also drink it down with Emergen-C. 

That's all! After a week up it if it doesn't feel like enough. 

I have been doing this for over a year and have only had one brief migraine - 2 weeks ago. I don't take it on the weekends because breakfast isn't routine for me on weekends. I do occasionally get a mild headache on a weekend here and there and will remember to take the B2. It goes away pretty quick.

No noticeable side effects. Yes, neon urine! 

Definitely an Affordable option other migraine sufferers should check out. 

I love the TwinLabs capsules because they are small (very small). Even if you had to take four, no problem! 

I will probably have to take these for life! Small price compared to the chemicals the doctors will prescribe and what they will do to your body 10 years from now.

I hope this helps!

I used the sea buckthorn for skin and Chitosan capsules from the Chinese company TIENS. After I popped the larger blisters and washed the area with antibacterial soap, I applied ample amounts of the oil directly on the blisters- then I covered the oil with the Chitosan powder from inside the edible capsules- covering the blisters with a waterproof bandage big enough to completely cover both the wound and oil. I changed the bandages and oil twice a day for 1.5 weeks- until I was sure any threat of infection was over. From the first 10 hours I put it on- there was less pain and irritation. Then I continued to put the oil and chitosan on for another 5 days but left it uncovered.

after less than 2 weeks all the burns were totally healed and left with healthy pink skin with no irritation. 

At one point at the start of treatment I was advised to use an antibacterial ointment, but found the pain to be almost unbearable, and could feel the start of infection after a few hours...so I washed it completely off and resumed using the sea buckthorn oil and chitosan from Tiens. ",1

Did the cream at least reduce the fine lines?  I found that it has  tremendously.  Additionally, You took pills to moisturize your skin...wouldn't it be more efficacious if you applied the oil to your skin directly to moisturize it?  I too have used the oil for my skin to moisturize it, and found it works better when you put it on the skin.

Anyhow, I put that I have used the oil for treatment of burns, and so I shall explain here why I think it works well according to my review.  Several weeks ago, in celebration for 4th of July, I lit some fire works and got a severe, blistering burn on my thumb.  I did the standard rinsing of my burn wound under tepid water, but the blisters still formed.  So as treatment, I applied a 5% sea buckthorn seed oil solution daily to the ruptured blisters.  I kid you not, the blisters healed in 5 days, and I do not have any scars resutling from the burn.  

I have also used the oil on my boyfriend's skin when he got sunburned, and the pain and the peeling were at a minimum.  

For acne, I gave some oil to myboyfriend's stepson to use a a moisturizer and for his acne, which was moderate at about 10-15 pimples just on his chin.  He used the 5% oil solution with sea buckthorn seed oil twice a day, and after a week, his skin drasticly improved to a single small blemish at a time on his entire face.

Finally, i have used the oil on my kids skin whenever they get scrapes, and those too have healed with minimal to no scarring.  It is now to the point that eveery time they get an ""owie,"" they come straight to me so that I can put oil on them.  ",0

Decided it was worth a try as my hip was killing me, could not even sleep on my right side at night. I am a huge skeptic so was really surprised when I noticed a difference the 2nd day. I slept on my right hip last night for the first time in weeks. Don't know what it is in it that works, but it does. My doctor said organic tart cherry concentrate, 2 tablespoons in the AM and in the PM, in 2 and a half ounces of warm water would work as well as that you can buy at GNC or Vitamin Shoppe. It is a little expensive, as it was $6.39 for a QT. at Kroger, but still cheaper than the medication I was on, which was colchicine. That is one bad medicine with some bad side effects. Could only take it 2 days in a row. Glad I am off it already. It may not work for everyone, but it sure did for me. Very little pain in my hip now during the day or at night. ",42

At the beginning of the week the symptoms weren't so bad, but now they are terrible and I absolutely have to stop the PureVia. I can't believe this is happening, but this is literally the ONLY thing that I have changed in my diet and I am 100% sure it has to be the PureVia causing it. I talked to my mom (at least about the headaches!) and she told me that some of the Stevia 'brands' use a processed extract called Rebiana (or RebA) and add dextrose (like PureVia does!) instead of just using the natural plant. I did some more research and it turns out that the actual plant has been used with great results for thousands of years but the RebA extract has NOT been properly studied before being released (WHY they use it instead of just what is naturally occurring is beyond me).

I have grown stevia for my own use for years with absolutly NO adverse reactions. It is organic, no pesticides or other chemicals used. I believe when you purchase many products grown for businesses for resale, they tend to use chemicals. ANYTHING sprayed or used on any plant does get absorbed by it and then passed on to us. Before the experts start telling you about side effects of any plant - use a non polluted sample along with a commercial one in testing. So many of these tests are skewed to promote other products such as aspertame or splenda. The best use I found for those is a fast effective ant killer. Keep the chemicals, I will stick with nature.

I found Truvia et al WAY too expensive so decided to take matters into my own hands. Armed with a calculator, I first of all purchased 16 oz Stevia extract with 90% Steviasoides from Mood and Mind. My aim was to produce a calibrated liquid extract that I could add to food and drink. I figured that my 1lb pack gave me the equivalent sweetening power of 350 lbs of sugar (about a 15 years supply!) and worked from there.

This is what I calculated.. add 10 grams of the above product (I have an inexpensive cooking scale that measures to 1 gram) to 700 ml water in a bottle or jar and shake well. Refrigerate. I obtained a kid's 5ml medicine dropper calibrated into 1ml divisions for $1.00 and my calculations mean that 1ml of this liquid is equal to 1 teaspoon of sugar .. and yes it works!  I have used it to make a spectacular organic walnut cheesecake, to sweeten iced tea, iced coffee, salad dressing.. I will keep a dropper bottleful in my purse for use when I'm away from home. I have also checked out research into health benefits and found that Stevia is used for treating diabetes, high blood pressure and heartburn; for lowering uric acid levels; and for increasing the strength of the muscle contractions that pump blood from the heart. As I have an inherited genetic condition called Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy and have to take a Uric Acid-elevating diuretic for the consequential heart failure, this could be a great ""treatment"" for me..

I take 14 medications daily so I'm pretty diligent about researching side effects and interactions. Have gained weight over the years due to perm damage of strokes and the different facets of lupus - am unable to get much exercise.  I eat very healthy but need my morning coffee sweetened.  Had been using spenda in each of my 3 cups each morning. About two weeks ago I decided to try stevia to help with my attempts at weight loss. Tasted quite good.  Have been in a lupus flare for about a month, and just finished a dose pak of prednisone.  Due to the aroused lupus symptoms I didn't even realize that I'd been building up to a allergic reaction to the stevia. Hands and feet swelling (pins n needles), eyes puffy and irritated and face getting a little redder each day. Inside lips felt swelled and throat was even a sore, a little dificulty swallowing - felt somewhat better as each day went on. BUT last night I had a cup of coffee with stevia (very rarely drink coffee in evening). Awoke 4am with burning red face. Arose for the day at 9:30.  I could feel all the symptoms getting stronger as I was drinking coffee. Finally realized/recognized that it must be an allergic reaction to the stevia! Made worse by the late evening coffee! Poured out my third cup and headed to the ER for treatment.  Sometimes we get so used to how our bodies feel that we don't immediately recognize new effects/symptoms.  ",4

Well, I don't know if others will have such astonishing results, but I would say that considering the risks vis-à-vis pharmaceuticals designed to treat the SYMPTOMS of these diseases at the other end (i.e. by blocking reuptake of neurotransmitters), it seems like it makes more sense to address the issue at its source, i.e. ""feeding"" the brain and allowing it to convert what it really needs, rather than bombarding it with chemicals. Of course, there's no money to be made in this since it’s natural therefore unable to be patented, so gee, I wonder why NO DOCTOR has ever recommended this to me, and why I had to suffer the insufferable for so long!!!

I based this trial on the reading of the new book by Linus Pauling, Vitamin C and the Common Cold. My life changed dramatically as I ceased getting colds as long as I kept taking at least 4-5 grams (4,000-5,000 milligrams) every morning without fail, and then an additional 1-2 grams after supper. Later, I found I needed more, and if I did begin to feel a virus coming on, I found that I had to take extra, up to 8 grams at a time, to stave off or reduce the impact and symptoms and duration. Often I need to then take an additional 2-4 grams every few hours in the first day or two to knock the virus out or almost out. If waiting more than a few hours when the very first symptoms begin to come on, it is less effective. If waiting more than a half a day it may do very little and you get the cold almost as you would without it. One thing I had to start doing after a number of years was take calcium and magnesium with the C to buffer it. I had big problems with ester-C and other pre-buffered C's which were too alkaline and messed up my gut worse than the pure C which is too acidic. I had to find a balance that worked for me. I have also successfully used C to stop the flu from progressing past the first few hours. C is the one vitamin I would never do without, if I could only afford to buy ONE supplement this would be it. I am amazed more people don't use it like my wife and I have learned to do, but you do have to take a LOT for it to really work this way. If you have a very direct exposure to a virus and not enough sleep, etc., then this will only do so much good, but normally it works incredibly well if you take it every day and take enough for you.

I have tried just about every vitamin or supplement that is said to help anxiety...Valerian Root, 5 HTP, B complex caps, and a few others. None of these supplements helped my anxiety like I'd hoped. I read a few articles online about how people with anxiety disorders can benefit from taking Vitamin C. So, I went out and bought some thinking that it was probably not going to work. Well, the day I bought them I took two 500 mg tabs, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. I felt calmer even the first day I took Vitamin C. I have been taking 1000 mg for the last few months and can't believe how I feel. My symptoms of OCD and Panic disorder are greatly reduced.

I ingest a food or substance (like maltodextrin)
that triggers an inflammatory response.  Also
none of the prescription or over-the-counter pain
meds I have tried have helped with the bone pain.
I found out that I had become calcium-depleted from heavy-metal poisoning from a medical implant.
The intense bone pain has consistently responded to Calcium Supplementation which I take along with Magnesium and now Vitamin D.  These 3 working together have helped decrease the widespread muscle pain I experience part of every day. After
years of depletion and mineral imbalances because 
to the level levels of metal in my body, it is a
daily process to keep the muscle pain away or at least at much lower levels.  I no longer experience the bone pain at all unless I forget
to take these supplements for a few days. The
muscle pain is much trickier to control but I know
from experience that for me dietary restrictions,
Calcium/Magnesium in equal amounts and Vitamin D
especially when I can't get out in the sunshine are essential in controlling the recurring widespread muscle pain/spasms.
Reading others negative experiences with Vitamin D, I know first hand sensitivity response
reactions to foods, medicines, and additives that
others handle well.  But also I notice and have
experienced myself that doctors often prescribe
very large doses for all their patients without
starting them out at a lower dose (which may even
be equally effective) to try to minimize any sensitivity reactions or adverse side effects.
After 6 months on a certain medicine, I asked my doctor if she would increase my dose a little bit.  She ""tripled"" my dosage abruptly without ""titrating"" it upward slowly as recommended. 50,000 IU sounds like a lot

Muscle and Bone Pain
Are Vitamin D Side Effects


This is a side effect of vitamin d that is not so easy to remedy and is actually a sign that you really NEED TO CONTINUE taking the vitamin d. If you experience Pain from Vitamin D this very likely means that your bones have become somewhat demineralized from having vitamin d deficiency for a very long time. When your bones are demineralized and you begin Vitamin D Therapy, this can cause calcium to begin to go back into the bones. When the calcium goes into the bones it drags fluids with it. This fluid can actually cause a small expansion of the 'collagen matrix' inside the bones and this expansion pushes out against the exterior covering of the bone which is very inflexible and has extensive nerve endings. 

When this occurs, you can experience this as bone pain or even muscular pain. If you experience new or worsening pain from taking vitamin d, it is NOT Vitamin D Contraindication, a reason to be scared or to stop taking the vitamin d. If you continue with the Vitamin D Therapy, the pain should subside in several weeks. While uncomfortable, you will be better off in the long run if you manage the pain for this time and 'get through' to the other side.

I have had bone pains and fatigue when initially taking vits/minerals but it went away after a month. I look at it like this - after exercising, the typical feeling is soreness.  Upon consumption of anything, our bodies will experience some sort of physical/emotional/biological feeling because the body is trying to ""purify"" itself.  Symptoms and side effects are not the same thing.  Check with your Dr about what you're feeling and determine whether it is due to (in this case) Vitamin D, or if the Vitamin D is rebuilding your body and the pain is just part of the process.

My doctor tried everything and finally sent me to a rheumatologist. The rheumatologist had a blood test done and found that I was vitamin D deficient. He prescribed vitamin D2 at 50,000u once a week which immediately stopped the pain and pneumonia. Two years ago, I switched to vitamin D3 at 2000u daily which is the natural form. the switch was seamless except that taking the pill daily can be a problem for someone who is forgetful like me. If I miss 2 - 3 days in a row, I immediately return to body aches and tiredness. I know my kidneys do not convert the vitamin D well so I need to keep up with my dose. I am thinking about going back to the D2 once a week just to avoid the hassle of the daily dose. another issue with D3 is that taking more  than 4000u daily can cause serious side effects. I misread the label on a new bottle of D3 and took 5000u daily for about a week. I had vertigo from calcium crystals in my inner ear fluid, calcium deposits in my bladder, and a bout with kidney stones. As long as I stay with my suggested dose of D3, it has been a wonder drug.",3

It is about a year ago, my doctor said my D level is only 10.xx. I still can not handle D supplement in low does after that extreme dry mouth and eyes experience at 2 months ago.

Here is what happened to me in the past 1 year. 

1. No problem when I start took 50,000 iu once a week for few weeks. Its is D3 from fish with doctor's prescription.

2. Over energy when I took it few times a week. So, doctor want me take 2000 iu daily. But, I only took 1000iu two or three times a week. 

3. Maybe dry eye (not dry mouth yet) start when I took 1000iu every other day. I know I have dry eye issue because all new contact lens cause my eye dry. But, this maybe because I am almost 50, so dry eyes is very normal in my age when I wear contact lens. 

4. Check D level again, only 25. So, doctor still wants me to take up to 2000 iu per day.

5. I start experience extreme dry eye and dry mouth after had took 1800 iu or 15000iu per day. By the way, I also start took Calcium with D at that time.

6. Finally, I called doctor, and stop taking any D and Cal supplements. 

7. After stop it for few days, no extreme dry issue anymore, but still feel dry eyes, and still not dare to wear contact lens.

8. After stop a month, I feel much better, but still dry eyes (not extreme). Check D level again, it drop back to 10.50.

9. I try on very low does D once a while, all caused my extreme dry. D 400iu supplement, a cup of milk with D, or a cup of almond milk with D for few days.

Now, I decide stop any food or drink with D supplement at least 3 months. I am not sure what I am going to next.

After my unpleasant D experience, I start vitamin supplement searching, I found a lot of supplement also contains herbs. I also found 1 of my Cal + D supplement does contains a herb which I better keep away.

Dr. took blood panel & didn’t even mention my vitamin D score @ 15. When I researched it on my own I asked for the recommended 50,000 iu (D2) once a week for 8 wks. She said “I’ve been a dr. for 30 some years & vitamins are at the bottom rung of things that can be wrong with you.” She advised seeing a psychiatrist.

I gave her the name of Michael Holick MD, a pioneer in vitamin D research who has written a book, & also the site of the National Vitgamin D Council. At 9:00 am the very next day she called in the script. She had no clue about the importance of D or how to assess the numbers from the test. Apparently she did the research I had requested- thank God.

A tip for not having side effects with the high D dosage- take it with a large, fatty meal. It’s a perfect excuse to cheat & have fried foods or lots of butter without guilt. I have had no side effects by doing this (I think I read it on Cleveland Clinic or Dr. Holick’s site). Not through my regimen yet but am feeling brighter with more energy.

Just like educating my Dr., I plan to spread the word to everyone I know about the importance of D deficiency and how it also eventually leads to other serious illnesses. I live in Ohio & heaven knows we don’t get sun for a large part of the year. I am also fair skinned, so slather on the sunscreen in the summer. My body probably could never produce enough D on its own with these circumstances.

One dr. who has done many studies is calling D defiency an epidemic in this country, and unfortunately most doctors haven’t heard anything about it. It’s up to us to educate them!

I wish you all well, Ceci

After reading all your posts some people need to do a bit more research on Vitamin D dosage. There are 2 types of Vitamin D in the body. Vitamin D2 is created by the body and then gets transformed to Vitamin D3. Thi 50,000 IU of Vitamin D is Vitamin D2. This creates a high level of Vitamin D2 but gets slowly converted to D3. Vitamin D3 is what the body uses and no Doctor would ever give someone 50,000 IU of Vitamin D3. It takes months of a high level of Vitamin D3 intake to create toxic levels. So rest assured the 50,000 IU of Vitamin D2 is safe. I am being treated with 50,000 IU because I have had muscle spasm and bone pain for 8 years after I was finally diagnosed with Vitamin D Deficiency (20) I have to take it once a week and have only been doing so for 1 weeek. I did notice some severe muscle twitching, but it was in the areas that I have severe muscle spasm (trigger points). Twitching to me indicates that the D is working because the muscles are reacting to something foreign to them. Also, with any treatment, one should always give the treatment at least a month before discontinuing.

I have been afraid to take the extra calcium and Vit D until I am done with the 50,000 mg. It just seems to be a large amount.  I go to an endocrinologist, and she faithfully tests my Vit D levels. When I first went to her she tested my thyroid because I was exhausted all the time and have body pains. My thyroid was l-o-w and am now on a 50 mg pill a day for that. I have hypothyroid (according to others I've talked to, this is not unusual as you get older). Due to this, my doctor started testing my calcium and Vit D. I can remember my mom telling me that I had rickets when I was a baby and would not walk. I do not know what the treatment was at that time, but I do know she took me to the doctor. My doctor was not surprised to hear this news since I have low calcium and Vit D. My energy level increased due to the thyroid treatment. I am hoping when this calcium and Vit D gets to working, my body will be pain free. I have never had any problems taking the high dose of 50,000 mg and faithfully take it once a week until it will be gone (I have great faith in my doctor). Then I will faithfully take the others daily and be retested again. I even double checked with the office girl about this and she called me back and said I was to take the daily supplements in between the 50,000 doses.

Have been taking Rx for 18 years and it DID save my life. Got better, but still never really felt 100% at any time over the years.

I read about Vit D3 deficiency (http://www.vitamindcouncil.org) and got tested (using the correct test (25-hydroxyvitamin D test, also called a 25(OH)D ) . I was woefully deficient (28). Need to be in the 50-80 range, so started with the 2,000 IU/day and then found the 5,000 IU pill at iHerb.com (FYI: use DAH122 for $5.00 off your first order - my gift to you, :)  ) 

Since taking the Vit D3, my mood has dramatically improved - to the point that I am NOT taking any pharmaceutical Rx for depression for the first time in 18 years! I am truly amazed. Also, my overall health is better, my 'bad' cholesterol levels are dropping, no colds - not even the sniffles - since taking Vit D3. I've LOST approx. 25 pounds (read this may be due to NOT TAKING the anti-depressant). 

I will continue to take Vit D3 until I die. Absolutely remarkable results! Living in MN coupled with Scandinavian heritage, this vitamin is a MUST. I would recommend you get your Vit D3 levels checked.. and remember, if the lab you Dr. uses is Quest, then you have to multiply your results by 1.3 to get a more accurate result. Quest Labs have 'issues' and  yes, you can Google it for yourself. And don't listen to those that say a range of 30-40 is 'normal' and 'fine'. READ the results of the clinical RESEARCH, even if it is lengthy and technical.. Please don't be swayed by the pharmaceutical companies (and the FDA's)disinformation.  Take charge of YOUR life and do the research! You'll be glad you did.

The brand I use is not listed (Healthy Origins), so I just picked one.

Problems included: severe fatigue, muscle pain, severe joint swelling and pain, bone pain, ""foggy"" feeling, sinus problems, ear problems, a positive ANA test result and breathing problems.  I've tried multiple treatments through several doctors and specialists.  Switched to a new doctor and - during intake - found low Vitamin D levels.  Doctor prescribed 100,000 IU's to be taken one time each week for four weeks (to be retested following).  Initially, I experienced an increase in pain, almost like a tenderness all over my body.  However, the joint swelling, pain, sinus, and several other problems have subsided and the tenderness is getting better.  It wasn't overnight, but I am getting better.

I would highly recommend this treatment.  I know some of the prescribed levels sound scary, but it has helped me to finally experience relief after 10 years of pain...and the level I am taking is short term.  Please stay at it as best you can, I experienced relief from my symptoms and I believe that you can as well, but you'll need to stick with it.

The only reason I rated the ""Effectiveness"" section with 2 stars was due to the fact that I haven't completed treatment yet. I haven't noticed any changes with my symptoms, but I'm not sure if my symptoms are due to the D deficiency and I'm only half way through the prescription I was given.  I know many people are hesitant to take 50,000iu (as I was and to be truthful it still gives me pause every time I take it) and I wanted to share my experience with others who are deficient. 

From all the research I have gathered over the last several weeks of reading up on the subject of D deficiency - this is something people shouldn't take lightly.  The medical community have finally realized that D deficiency leads to a whole host of medical problems.  Vitamin D can not only provide treatment for some conditions, but actually prevent others from occurring in the first place.  I couldn't deny the facts and knew I had to take this or possibly deal with greater problems in the future as a result of depriving my body of something it vitally needs.  

One other point I wanted to mention for others who might be going through the same experience I am and that's Vitamin D deficiency and an underactive thyroid.  The information on a possible connection  between the two conditions on medical sites have been sketchy - it's alluded to in some writings, but nothing concrete is documented.  Maybe it's wishful thinking on my part that the D deficiency is the cause for the thyroid problem, but only time will tell.  My thyroid is a little underactive, but yet my thyroid antibodies test is negative for hypothyroidism.  So, again, maybe there isn't a link between the two conditions. 

I will give another update if anything new happens, if not, I will give a final entry at the end of October when I go for another set of blood tests to see if the D has increased my numbers.",65

Even after stopping my daily weight lifting program three months ago I am still having normal, pain free, diarhea free daily bowel movements so it was not the exercise that contributed to my beating IBS.

 I have advised others to try it and they have reported the same results as myself. I have no idea why it works, I just KNOW that it does for me and perhaps it will help you as well.
For more info please watch my video on YOUTUBE titled BEAT IBS with WHEY PROTEIN.

Good Luck and my greatest hope for you is that you too can FINALLY lead a normal life as I do now!

I never mentioned it to my doctor.  Just treated it with a mixture of drawing salve, cortisone and triple antibiotic.  Then dressed it with a bandage to keep from scratching.  If would reappear from time to time.  Once it felt worse than ever, so I used my phone to make pictures..  Oh dear, this was like nothing  I was familiar with.  I had an appointment with my doc the next day.  I showed him the pix.  He said that is herpes.  I was shocked and mortified.  I jumped up and pulled down my pants and showed him my many blisters all clustered together.  We decided to treat it when I had a breakout with an antiviral.  It only helped a little.  I did research and found a possible solution.  I started taking 2 famcyclovire at first sign of trouble and using imiquidone cream for several days.  Results were astounding, but still frequent breakouts.  I had bought DMSO (vet supply) for my hubby who was critically ill and was having many bladder infections associated with MS.  Desperate measures call for desperate acts.  He was already using colllodial silver so I gave it to him together with d-mannose(for UIs).
After what I had read I was willing to try it.  Next breakout of herpes I took the famvir and a quarter spoon of DMSO i also mixed DMSO with the imiquidone.  Blessed be.  The breakout cleared up in a hurry.  I did not have another one for about 5 or 6 months.  When I did have one just starting, I repeated my treatment.    Have not had another one in a year.

To me, it didn't really work for that (difficult to apply). But now I have severe arthritic joint pain too and it definitely works for that, for me. For the back, one thing that really worked and got me mobile was acupuncture. That was last year (2015) and it was really amazing after just wanting to lay down all the time, in pain. I'm quite physical etc. To stay that way is critical at my age. But the DMSO I would use externally and it goes thru the skin.

It healed the wounds in days. Medications make me very sensitive to sunlight and I burn easily. DMSO healed my 1st-2nd degree burns within 4-5 days. It caused my skin to peel faster, too. 

Don't put it on thick, or it may cause your skin to get red, raise a bit and swell with all it's forced to absorb, and if it's thick enough to drip, you'll have that red raised skin follow the drips. It does go away and didn't cause any injury, but it was uncomfortable. Just coat it enough to get your skin to glisten. The person that applied it enough to drip didn't know how to use it.

Also make sure your skin is clean and soap free of you'll find out what it's like to absorb soap. It does sting. Never use your fingers to apply it; use gloves, a cotton ball or a Q-Tip. Never ""double dip"" and contaminate the gel. It has no disinfectant properties, and it is possible to cross-contaminate that way. That's why if you use a roll-on stick, make sure only you use it and never share.

An elderly woman took a bad fall and scraped up her arm pretty badly. After an immediate application of DMSO after cleaning, her wound was gone in a matter of days. The skin of the elderly is very sensitive and fragile which makes it slower to heal, so this is remarkable!

I apply DMSO twice a day this way and got pain relief that has make it possible for me to do my normal activities that I could not do before.  The maximum pain relief came after 4 days of treatment.  Some people may think DMSO is like a placebo, the pain relief is only in the mind.  For myself I have proved this to not be the case.  When I have forgotten to use DMSO in the morning or evening the pain surprisingly comes back and then I remember I didn't use DMSO.  This product is so cheap that for $10 to $15 I can treat my pain for a year.  I now use it any time I have a pain and it seems to work.  I know this is hard to believe.  Side effects:  There might be a slight burning sensation when I apply it.  On a scale of 1 to 10 it is a 1 or less.  I have noticed a slight drying of the skin sometimes in the area of application.

No one has anything to gain from promoting this product.  No one can make much money on this since it is only an industrial solvent. I have read many unbelievable stories about this and watched the 60 Minutes segment on YouTube.  This is for real.  Since no one can make any money on this, there is not money to do controlled clinical trials.

I feel compelled to let the people know that ordinary DMSO 70-30 with aloe vera or distilled water will provide extensive relief from pain at a fraction of the cost of the prescription medication. I have noticed that alot of pensiad users are getting any benefit at all. They owe it to themselves to try the DMSO route. It positively cured the torn meniscus in my knee and my plantar in my heels and feet from years of competitive tennis. Shoulder and middle back spine pain have been all but erased also!

Anyway, I went to a doctor who didn't really care.  He barely even looked at me and prescribed me some crap that didn't work.  So since my skin was slowly deteriorating by the hour and big holes were starting to form, I decided to try the DMSO on it.  I put a thick layer on each bite with either some gauze or a bandaid depending on the size of the hole.  When I woke up the next morning it had pulled most of the poison out of the gashes in my body.  It had stopped the seepage and I could tell it was working.  So I cleaned it up and put some more on there and when i checked it again later each bite looked completely rejuevinated.  the skin cells looked brand new.  It went from a dark blood red to a white and pink healthy look.  I could tell all the poison was out.  I kept using it until I got back home ( I'm a truck driver so I was out on the road)and saw my doctor.  She looked me over and told me that it was a miracle that they didn't have to perform a surgery on me because she had never had a brown recluse case that didn't require surgery to stop the poison from spreading. It literally can eat away at your flesh like a slow seeping acid.  Anyways, my mom said it worked on her scars.  I personally have never used it for that use but I think all doctor's should try this product on any kind of insect bite but especially on brown recluse bites.

medicines to just 3 of them plus vitamins.  She
takes 25 mg lovastatin, 2 baby asprin and 25 mg
sertraline.  I had been giving her CoQ 10 as well.
When I stopped for a few weeks her age-related and
post TIA-mini-stroke Dementia got much worse.  Her
thought processes and mind-body connections became
very impaired making it difficult to communicate
with her effectively and difficult for her to stand or walk a couple feet.  I started giving her
the CoQ 10 again, and it was amazing.  Within 48 hours her previous physical and mental abilities returned.  She can complete her sentences which are again coherent, she can understand what I say,
and she can stand up for 5 minutes, walk across the room and even play Scrabble with me.  Without
the CoQ 10 it had become so difficult to take care
of her at home over a 6-8 week period that I thought I would have to put her in a Care Home. 
I read that Lovastatin causes CoQ 10 deplepletion
(along with the aging process).  I was totally amazed how fast CoQ 10 worked to reverse the totally debilitating process that was getting worse and worse for my mother.  With CoQ 10 daily,
(and blueberries) my mother is 96 years YOUNG again.    I have learned the hard way (both for myself and my mother) that it is very important to
thoroughly research how one's medicines may be negatively interacting, (causing reduced or increased absorption or other side effects) and how some medicines can result vitamin and mineral
deficiencies.

I am a 60 year old female, and I have been taking co-Q-10 supplements daily for over 20 years.  I began taking it after reading a research paper that indicated that co-Q-10 might be effective in increasing immune response.  My whole life prior to that time, I was extremely susceptible to infections; if someone with the flu or a cold even looked at me across a room, I got sick.  I was constantly sick as a child, and as an adult suffered what seemed like a continuous cold throughout the winter, along with episodes of the flu, bronchitis, etc.  NOTHING helped, not dietary intervention, not the then-popular vitamin C dosage, nothing.  After several months of taking a combined dose of co-Q-10, vitamin E and lecithin (a cocktail suggested in the research paper), I noticed that I was not getting sick as often.  I have continued the same dosage since that time, and I have not had a single cold while taking it.  No colds, no flu, no bronchitis, nothing. I did suspend the dosage for several weeks two or three times, to see if it made a difference.  It did.  Caught a cold.  Started dosage again and returned to cold-free status. (I should note that after reading reports earlier this year that long-term dosage with vitamin E could be harmful, I discontinued the vitamin E portion of the cocktail.  I have not noticed any decrease in effectiveness).   So I am curious to know if there have been any further studies on this effect of co-Q-10.  Is it possible that this could be a placebo effect of such lasting duration?  What say you, experts?  Inquiring minds want to know. ^_^

I think I experienced the serious negative side effects almost immediately after consumption.  I needed this product to help me detox ""toxins"" in my body -- mainly, candida and possibly mercury. I am also trying to decalcify my pineal gland. I so needed this product and wanted it to work in that I tried using it on 3 different occasions (varying the dosage)but with ultimately the same results.  Taking a lower dose, I was less sick but experienced the unpleasant side effect of nausea before the other symptoms hit.  The main unpleasant symptoms?  Repeated vomiting and severe diarrhea (coming out of both ends simultaneously -- I know, too much information).  Retching to the extent of having a sore throat the next day.  Lying supine on the bathroom floor for hours feeling intensely weak and ill.  At least, when I lowered the dose I didn't think I was going to die for the side effects and they did not last as long (3-4 hours vs 8 - 10).  My belief is that supplement worked but that my system is so riddled with ""poisons"" that the die-off (mainly of candida) was too much for my system to handle.  I experienced similar symptoms when I finished the protocol of hydrogen peroxide (food grade) therapy but that took 3 weeks to build up to the dosage that would cause the candida to ""die-off"" which of course, inundates your system with toxins and feels like (I imagine) heroin addicts must feel when they detox -- it is a living nightmare and you do feel like you may not survive it.  I wish I could tolerate the yaeyama chlorella that I took because I think it does its job, its just that the side effects are immediate and intolerable and consistently happen.

After 6 months I felt 100% 
better, I still take Sun Chlorella, and Milk Thistle, also Kelp , spirulina, and vegan diet, I have tried other less expensive brands of chlorella, but none worked like Sun Chlorella.
The comment about nausea after taking Chlorella was well clarified by next comment.
The toxins in your body that you are exposed to every day are ""toxic""!!! The nausea you experienced was your bodies response to releasing the toxins, milk thistle is a liver detoxifier, research it, Chlorella is the very best medicine you can take !!!",4

It is very important to start very slowly with the smallest dose possible and then build up the doseage.  Note your symptons and if you experience sickness, know that it is caused by the release of toxins.  You may have to stop for a few days, or unti your system settles down, and then begin agin. Take the mimimum dose and continue with the same routinue until you can proceed with ease.  Always go slowly, take a break if needed, do not force yourself,cbnrb if you feel sick. Remember, toxins are poisens that you have stored in your body for a long time. Chlorella is a food and offers many health benefits.  It is worth giving it a chance.

Since I'm an organic eating vegan and consider myself very healthy and relatively detoxed already, I haven't had any real side effects. I could see, however, experiencing some rather uncomfortable headaches and nausea if you are very toxic in your system and then slam in the Chlorella all of a sudden.

Before taking Chlorella, I took Klamath Blue-Green Algae for years. Like all algae supplements, it's very important that you get a product that isn't contaminated.

In my experience, it's the contaminated products that make people experience the harsh symptoms like nausea, vomiting, etc. As WebMD states in their own description of blue-green algae in general, ""blue-green algae products that are contaminated are LIKELY UNSAFE...Contaminated blue-green algae can cause liver damage, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, weakness, thirst, rapid heartbeat, shock, and death. Don’t use any blue-green algae product that hasn’t been tested and found free of mycrocystins and other contamination.""

I guess others who wrote about having these symptoms might just be allergic rather than hitting upon a contaminated product, but for me, I've had no problems with the Yarrow Formulas so far. Only time will tell, as I just started on this one, putting it in my morning smoothie along with Reishi, Chaga and Astralagus Root.",31

Folic acid is synthetic and cheap - but it is not what the body uses.  It has to convert it to methylfolate first.

my treatment isn't really any of your business what is important is that the info i was looking for you don't provide  that is which forms are natural and which if any are man made (and therefore suspect to being bad or ineffective). there was no way provided for a curious user to ask questions

It was intensely itchy for such a small area of skin irritation. The dermatologist prescribed a cortisone cream which worked, but when the cream was discontinued, the lesion and itching came right back. Then I read an article about skin rashes that were the result of low selenium. A doctor recommended eating two Brazil nuts per day to obtain selenium for this type of rash. So I tried this solution and much to my amazement within three days the itching stopped and by the end of a week the lesion had cleared. Then I substituted a yeast based supplement containing selenium for the Brazil nuts and the rash came right back within days. This result was perplexing. Then I tried a better grade supplement, Swanson Albion Complex Selenium and the rash cleared as it had with the Brazil nuts. So the type of selenium supplement makes a huge difference. I would suggest for an atopic dermatitis type rash that the selenium could be tried for possible improvement. Results would be known within the first week.",2
