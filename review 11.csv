The taking of the Bomelain has shown a reduction of CRP's measured in blood from as high as '47' (during an acute inflammatory episode of the GI) to as low as '1' in a matter of one week.

Before taking the Bromelain the period of elevated CRP (as one marker)in blood, and pain and GI inflammation, was significantly extended during such an episode.

Therefore it appears to be a helpful substance in this instance.",5

The Juice that is 100% cranberry juice and not from concentrate (without sugar) is getting harder to find, thanks unhealthy Americans... I found the juice can be used to prevent, and to treat the bladder spasms, but without antibiotics, the infection will remain and can cause kidney infections if left to long. I have woken up with an infection so bad I felt the need to pee every 2 minutes. After a glass of cranberry juice (the one with the sugar, I was in a hotel on my honeymoon), I was able to 'hold it' long enough to go to the doctor and wait to be seen. Awesome stuff.

The only difference was this… with the first UTI, I took cranberry capsules, with the 2nd UTI, I drank the pure cranberry juice. So, there was a BIG difference when I drank the actual juice. Don't buy the ones labeled ""Cranberry Juice Cocktail"" as those are just loaded with sugar. Instead, go to a health food store or the natural section of a supermarket & buy the ones marked ""100% Organic Cranberry Juice Not from Concentrate"".

I did and now regularly ""treat"" my infections with cranberry pills. I will start with about 800 mg and if the pain hasn't subsided within half hour-hour i will take another 400-800 mg and continue like this until it is gone all together. 
Sometimes that mean one day of between 800 and 3000 mg or days with this amount, give and take. I may feel uncomfortable and a varying pain during these days. 
I got a sort of phobia against Antibiotics and therefor want to avoid it as far as possible.

I used all natural, no additives dandelion plants right out of my backyard, how it should be used. Yes, I had to do a little bit of research beforehand, but we should all be doing that on ANY kind of medicine we take anyway, even if it's prescribed by professionals. It's good for us all to know exactly what we're being given, especially if you're going to a new doctor who doesn't have your full medical history, or what have you. Whatever the reason, it's a good idea. 

Anyway, I decided to make just a basic tea with the natural-picked dandelion leaves and roots in it, using about a teaspoon of roots and about 2 to 3 dried leaves for one cup, added honey and a little bit of lemon juice for taste (sadly, it can be very bitter to some), and my goodness, did it do wonders. In just a single weekend, with just the one cup of tea at the beginning, I felt so much better in my daily life. I didn't find myself to be so generally tired or fatigued, I found more interest in the things I love because I just, well, felt better. It was wonderful, and I highly recommend natural-picked, homemade dandelion tea to anyone who needs a stressor-free pick me up.

Now, there is a warning I would like to point out to some people. This plant can cause water in your body to, how to say, ""go right through you"" a bit more, so make sure you drink plenty of water along with the tea. Although, everyone should probably drink more water than we do anyway. :)
Also, if you have any kind of digestive or intestinal problem that causes any kind of chronic constipation or anything of the sort, do be careful using the leaves in the tea, though the roots have proven to act as a mild laxative by themselves. Just a tip I picked up in my readings.

As I said, this plant is absolutely amazing, and can be used in salad, tea, wines, you name it. So go out in your backyard and pick some for good health. :)",109

I based this trial on the reading of the new book by Linus Pauling, Vitamin C and the Common Cold. My life changed dramatically as I ceased getting colds as long as I kept taking at least 4-5 grams (4,000-5,000 milligrams) every morning without fail, and then an additional 1-2 grams after supper. Later, I found I needed more, and if I did begin to feel a virus coming on, I found that I had to take extra, up to 8 grams at a time, to stave off or reduce the impact and symptoms and duration. Often I need to then take an additional 2-4 grams every few hours in the first day or two to knock the virus out or almost out. If waiting more than a few hours when the very first symptoms begin to come on, it is less effective. If waiting more than a half a day it may do very little and you get the cold almost as you would without it. One thing I had to start doing after a number of years was take calcium and magnesium with the C to buffer it. I had big problems with ester-C and other pre-buffered C's which were too alkaline and messed up my gut worse than the pure C which is too acidic. I had to find a balance that worked for me. I have also successfully used C to stop the flu from progressing past the first few hours. C is the one vitamin I would never do without, if I could only afford to buy ONE supplement this would be it. I am amazed more people don't use it like my wife and I have learned to do, but you do have to take a LOT for it to really work this way. If you have a very direct exposure to a virus and not enough sleep, etc., then this will only do so much good, but normally it works incredibly well if you take it every day and take enough for you. There were a few times I tried stopping taking it but always got more colds again so went back.",19

I have moderate social phobia, and for the last three years have been experiencing symptoms of OCD and Panic Disorder. I have been prescribed klonopin for anxiety in the past, but only took it a few times because of the risk of addiction. So, I began searching for a natural solution to my anxiety problems. I have tried just about every vitamin or supplement that is said to help anxiety...Valerian Root, 5 HTP, B complex caps, and a few others. None of these supplements helped my anxiety like I'd hoped. I read a few articles online about how people with anxiety disorders can benefit from taking Vitamin C. So, I went out and bought some thinking that it was probably not going to work. Well, the day I bought them I took two 500 mg tabs, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. I felt calmer even the first day I took Vitamin C. I have been taking 1000 mg for the last few months and can't believe how I feel. My symptoms of OCD and Panic disorder are greatly reduced. I feel more calm now and I don't get stressed out easily anymore. I would recommend that anyone struggling with an anxiety disorder at least Give Vitamin C a try.

Firstly, it is best applied without touching the ointment directly, as it's something you don't want to get onto your hands, where it can dangerously be transferred to much more sensitive tissue, such as eyes.  Secondly, this treatment is most effective as an adjunctive therapeutic agent, along with effective analgesia and a hot, soaking bath.

I didn't have depression, anxiety, or any mood disorder; apart from the hair-pulling, I was completely healthy. After stopping Abilify cold-turkey (my doctor at the time told me this would be okay; she was WAY wrong), I experienced an intense 5-day-long anxiety attack.  Just constant panic, depression, crying, and depersonalization. On day 5, the ""episode"" ended just as suddenly as it began.

Ever since then, I'd have weeks of normalcy--even a slight euphoria--and then about 3 days of anxiety and depression that would, again, start without warning, and end just as suddenly.  Sometimes it was 3 days, sometimes more; sometimes it was so bad I couldn't function. Some episodes were more mild, but still very disrupting my life. I also began to pull more hair than ever.

I saw many doctors and was diagnosed with everything from General Anxiety, to Postpartum Depression (I gave birth a year ago), to Bipolar disorder. I knew in my heart the Abilify had caused this, somehow.

I read in a few forums about people having great success with TwinLab Amino Fuel, L-glutamine powder, and magnesium (all three taken together in the mornings on an empty stomach--I take 40 mL, 1 teaspoon, and 250 mg, respectively). I decided to give it a try, since I was desperate, and Abilify had scared me off psychiatric drugs permanently.

Within a week, I felt a LOT better. I started taking another 250 mg magnesium before bed, and now (2 months later) I feel even better, almost 100%. I do get ""twinges"" of anxiety now and then, but they are so mild and fleeting, I barely notice them; on these days I take an extra magnesium midday. I know the other supplements are helping a lot too, but the magnesium is great just by itself. It feels like I have my life back!! Highly recommend no matter what kind of anxiety you have.",73

However, a year ago I began experiencing issues with peripheral vascular disease associated with varicose veins (ulcerations and subcutaneous bleeding on my calves, joint pain and stiffness, planar fasciitis and chronic leg cramps). 

Within weeks of treating my varicose veins with compression stockings and elevation, I noted increased postural tachycardia, which became debilitating after 3 months (could no longer work). While waiting to see my PCP, I came off the melatonin and both my tachycardia and varicose veins began improving significantly. Three weeks after discontinuing its use, the tachycardia disappeared and the varicose veins improved enough to allow me to go without compressions stockings for intervals of several hours.

Have found nothing to explain the correlation but for a study in European Journal of Phramocology, vol 345, 1 March 1998 (NIH medical journal database), where the authors discuss the presence of MT1 & MT2 receptors (to which melatonin binds) in smooth muscle of vascular tissue and their role in vasodilation and constriction, respectively, as an explanation for melatonin’s systemic efficacy.

While my overall condition improved when I discontinued use, I did experience a brief period of cognitive impairment and an uptick in mean blood pressure, the latter of which may require me to seek treatment should it persist. Finally have a follow-up with a cardiologist.

But the problem is, each brand and dose of melatonin (and possibly each ""batch"") is SO different. A few brands have worked consistently better than prescription sleep aids for me, but unfortunately MOST brands are either ineffective, or produce the opposite effect desired (eg, I needed a Xanax to counteract the nervous, gittery feelings, then I still couldn't sleep but at least I wasn't jittery.)

One 3mg brand I like is pretty consistent for me (and $3/month! cheap!), but the same brand has a few other doses, plus a ""dissolvable"" 3mg dose with sweetening added, and of course all the bottles look the same, so I've accidentally bought the wrong ones (or if the right ones were sold out, tried another dose): ALL the other doses of the ""good brand"" didn't work. And the sugary one gave me the ""nervousness"" effect.

After a few YEARS of trying melatonin for sleep (on and off), though I have a decent one now, I really think the FDA should be looking at what these vitamin companies put into these pills. At least there should be consistency from ""batch to batch"" (same brand/dose).

So when you hit luck with a good one, it's very effective. But it really feels like a crapshoot when you open the next bottle. I'd love to put my brand/dose as 5-star satisfaction, but since this review is just ""melatonin"", I've got to consider the rest of my experiences with melatonin. Mostly positive, but even the few times I've gotten ""the jitters"" ...why package and sell a sleep aid that makes insomnia a nightmare?

This can make one feel as though they haven't slept. Best to start with a small dose and increase until you find a dosage that makes you sleepy in the 20 min range. Then go to bed. If you don't your body will just work it through and it will do no good. I also like to combine this with Valerian root which produces a sound sleep. Also non addictive. One of each on any given work night is about the right dose for me.  The melatonin dose is 1mg and the valerian is 500 mg.  I have taken up to 10 mg of melatonin with no ill effects, however you will need 8-11 hours of sleep with that dosage and you may still wake up groggy.

I've tried a number of brands of melatonin, but many don't work. I've settled on Natrol, because it works. There are probably others that work also, but I haven't seen any reason to experiment unless/until the Natrol becomes unavailable or stops working. Remember that these are not manufactured as drugs and there is no required test for what's in the tablet. If the first brand doesn't work for  you, try others until you find one. That doesn't mean you will necessarily succeed - melatonin doesn't work for everybody. Try it, though. Start with low doses and adjust as you see how it affects you. Good luck!",54

947,15,4/28/2014 9:01:30 PM,Benzodiazepine withdrawal,"John shepherd, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months",3,5,3,"Benzodiazepines cause tolerance and physical dependence within two to four weeks, and, upon cessation acute withdrawal traditionally requires tapered management. Additionally in some long term users experience withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal syndrome can last many months and is typified by a major depressive episode, agitation, and lack of ability to get to sleep. This is a serious side effect which needs careful monitoring.
ol
For this reason Benzodiazepines need to be used with extreme caution and for very short periods.

Melatonin is effective for sleep disturbances that are not caused by an over active nervous system, such is in the case of Benzodiazepine withdrawal. It appears virtually ineffective during acute (tapered) withdrawal, although somewhat helpful during withdrawal syndrome. For this reason it's main purpose during withdrawal is an adjunct with other therapies.

To my knowledge Melatonin does not effect the calcium channels that have been disturbed by benzodiazepine usage and this is why, in my view, Melatonin is not very effective on it's own as an Anxiolytic (antianxiety agent.)

My experience is that SSRI's are not very effective for use for withdrawal, however responses to SSRI's are individual dependant.

It is essential to manage benzodiazepine withdrawal and protracted withdrawal syndrome using a variety of methods including CBT, but most effectively, using an alternative Anxiolytic, the most effective of which is Phenibut (CALMEXA).

Phenibut Calmexa is GABA with a phenyl ring that allows it to pass the blood brain barrier, therefore replacing the GABA depleted by benzodiazepine dependence. With medical management it can safely and entirely replace the use of Benzodiazepines, causing an alternative dependence both easier to taper with less risk of protracted withdrawal syndrome. 

Melatonin used together with Phenibut is very effective for inducing sleep, establishing and maintaining a sleeping pattern.

Different people have different response I am just thankful for sleep. You don't miss something till you don't have it.

Trouble falling and staying asleep. Erratic work schedule. I use melatonin infrequently but with extremely high doses (ie used 20mg last night). Result: vivid dreams, but it helps to keep me asleep.

I take 3mg of melatonin approximately mid-day to advance my sleep phase.  The timing needs to be precise in relationship to my internal body clock, which is not always easy to know.  If I wake after an hour of heavy dream sleep, my waking time is a reliable marker and I will take melatonin eight hours later.  If I hit the right timing window, I'll have fairly strong fatigue within an hour.  This lasts for a couple of hours.  I can't do certain kinds of work in this state, but I can do housework and listen to lectures.  I call it my stupid pill, but it doesn't actually make me stupid, but impairs my ability to generate outward focus.  Missing my window even once can make it hard to recover the required timing accuracy.  The difference is profound.  I can tell I miss the window because I have far less fatigue.  Taking coffee at the same time as the melatonin significantly reduces fatigue, but it also made the treatment less reliable.  Used to have an ""all nighter"" without fail at least once every three weeks for twenty years.  In my first year on melatonin, I lost control only three times and had to flip over.  Variability in the potency messed me up on one of those.  One vendor didn't work at all.  Another vendor works well most of the time, but some bottles aren't all there.  Think I get mild stomach irritation at night, nothing really to complain about, and it could be other things in the pill.  My life is spectacularly better since I discover this, having found the research myself.  Would love to find a 100% consistent formulation.

Leaves are complex factories that produce hundreds of compounds... one of which is Theanine. This compound counters the bad effects of Caffeine (more or less depending on leaf content). As a result Tea should be considered different from other drinks. Also if consumed as a whole leaf either steeped multiple times (Chinese method known as Gongfu) Tea  provides huge doses of antioxidents with decreasing levels of Caffeine allowing Tea to “Wake you in the morning, keep you throughout the day, and put you to sleep soundly at night.” This due to decreasing Caffeine, and the “soporific” (sleep inducing) effect of  Theanine.",2

I think it speaks for itself. I was told by my gasterointerologist that it is a great laxative. Just a word to the weary about that, I'm not sure how accurate the side effects page on this is listing diarrhea as a ""rare"" side effect, but I suppose the days where insomnia is your only company and the next day of work mocks you for it, on those days it's worth putting up with the less than pleasant side effects for the ability to stay up and get the job done. Just remember to back off the stuff when your hands start shaking, figure out how long it takes to get through your system and space out the caffeine in those intervals to avoid overdose. for me it's about 2-3 hours. Body weight plays a factor, I happen to be a lean man in his mid 20's, so you may have separate circumstances. It is easy to build up a tolerance similar to alcohol requiring substantially more to get the same effect. This also creates a chemical dependency that can cause migraines when your brain is deprived of it. I avoid this by putting up with the migraines for a few days and avoid caffeinated food and supplements for up to 3 months. After that time I generally have brought my brain's chemical dependency to next to nil and my tolerance back down to healthier levels.

Always in moderation, and remember, never do any physically demanding activities when you've taken caffeine, it reduces lung capacity and robs your muscles of nutrients causing them to fatigue very fast under strain. You can create heart problems if you are under it's effects and subject your heart to too much strain, your base heart rate is already elevated and the extra strain can be painful to endure.",24

Today is the 4th day of taking 5-HTP. I still feel sad, have negative thoughts and bouts of anger, but they quickly dissipate and no longer linger on to consume me like what they used to. There’s this sense of calmness that is allowing me to make sound judgements and decisions without being hampered by negative feelings all the time. I feel like the decisions that I make will lead to positive results, as opposed to bad endings that I used to feel prior to taking 5–HTP.
Might be too early, but I can safely say that I am no longer a victim of my own depressive thoughts.  I am no longer a person who is constantly sad and angry. The only flip side is that 5-HTP does wreak some havoc in my stomach and I feel bloated with gas at times. But it does seem to feel less intense as the days go and I am hoping that my gut will get used to this supplement. 
Overall, what a miracle supplement. My only regret is that why didn't anyone informed me about 5-HTP earlier. I feel as if so many decades of my life wasted on being weary all the time and so many days and opportunities to seek happiness were missed. Nonetheless, better late than never.

I experienced results within three days of taking 50mg once a day in the AM. It works for me, YMMV. The mood effect is subtle but consistent. My mood feels more stable, particularly more resilient. I have fewer anxiety spikes.

I didn't take it for sleep disturbance, but it has improved the quality of sleep significantly. I wake up much earlier and without grogginess when I've taken it the day before. I also have dreams that I remember. Part of the stress resilience I feel may come from the effects the 5-HTP has had on my sleep.

It's probably not a plug-and-play supplement that can safely be taken on its own. Do your research. I take l-tyrosine with it (to prevent dopamine depletion/imbalance). The recommended ratio is 10:1, but my body seems to do better with 5:1. Because 5-HTP can cause heart valve damage via increased peripheral serotonin, I take EGCG (which effectively neutralizes the peripheral serotonin that doesn't make it past the BBB) and omega-3 (to increase bio-availability of the EGCG).",5

I feel it's my duty to let everybody know that 5-htp actually works. I'll be honest with you and admit that I've been experimenting with MDMA, which on some occasion brought me lows (depression) for a few days after consuming it. Hearing it can help manage those symptoms, I decided to buy it. (It's really a harm reduction strategy and not an encouragment do to MDMA!)

Since buying 5-HTP, I've taken it twice, and NOT after MDMA but while completely sober and feeling fine, and unexpectedly it made me a whole lot more content and healed some low level anxieties. It actually made me feel good and not crave any kind of drug to make me more happy (i.e. alcohol, tobbaco, MDMA). It's not that I'm an addict by any means, but I often have this desire to get f****d up for no good reason really. It also made me sleep a whole lot better, without waking up during the night, and the dreams were crazy vivid and life-like but I liked it, it's interesting. Oh yeah, and there were some ""side effects"": sleepines, perhaps not feeling mentally as sharp, feeling a bit mellowed out. Well, it's not that any of these are bad by themselves, but they can sort of have an effect on your productivity. Taking it before bad is probably the wisest, so you sleep it over. :)

I forgot to mention: The first time I took 200 mg and I think it was a bit too much. I was feeling very balanced and in good mood, but overpowered by side effects. Second time it was 50 mg before sleep.

I'm not saying I'll start to use it regularly, but I can see it's potential for reducing depression and anxiety. It's legal and it really does have an effect which is definietly not placebo. I personally could probably reccomend it even for just having fun or relaxing. Why not take 100 or 200mg and chill out with friends? It does have some slightly euphoric effects. IMO far better and helthier than drinking booze or doing some drugs to achieve that feeling or get rid of anxieties. Just a thought!

Wish you the best :)",8

Effects usually hit 2-4 hours after taking it: general boost in mood, difficult to think negative thoughts, warm fuzzy feeling, sometimes even euphoria. Feelings of love, from loving what you're doing, to feeling better about people around you. Similar feeling to MDMA. I don't know why, it might just be my experience, but the effects seriously last 3 days or so. Then for about 3-4 more days just a general content feeling. After about a week you're back at baseline but I swear that's better than before when I never took any anti-depressants. 

BTW, messing with serotonin is dangerous, why I've never sought to get prescribed SSRIs or anything. That's why I only take 1 100mg pill every few days, it only takes a small amount to change the balance of serotonin in your brain. It takes other chemicals in your brain to work....so too much, and you might not even feel the desired effects, just the bad side effects. 100mg/day to me would be crazy. Side effects include a stiff jaw/temples, headaches, stomachache, vomiting, and can last as long it takes for your body to clear all the serotonin. I also don't take it at night as jaw clenching can be bad at night, sometimes even at my low dosage.",95

I have been struggling with depression and anxiety lately and decided to go back to taking this after losing all motivation for things and needed a ""pick me up"". My previous experience I used the recommended dose of 100 3x a day and it caused me to have more anxiety and lethargic feelings which I cannot surely say it was from the 5-HTP. However, this time taking it I have found a sweet spot in dosing and it has kick started a incredibly productive time full of optimism and positivity. I am pretty impressed to say the least. That one little pill a day has caused me to completely turn my mood around into something so positive so that I could go about my day with productivity again. I can also note that my sleep schedule and problems with insomnia have completely dissolved allowing me to have peaceful yet deep slumber every single night. I go to sleep and wake up in the same spot! I wake up feeling ready to start the day instead of wishing I had a few more hours to sleep. A side effect to take into consideration before trying out 5HTP is increased dreaming. It caused my first full blown lucid dream and has made my dreams more lucid and intense. To me it was a good side effect but it may be bothersome for others. Overall, I will continue to take one a day and see how far this goes. ",118

I have been on and off antidepressants for years, but nothing has ever 'worked'. I would give up on them after a few months, until things got absolutely unbearable again & would finally drag myself off to the doctors to try another one. Even St Johns Wort had awful effects, and I essentially got to the point of accepting my perpetual unhappiness, and considering suicide as inevitable & the only option for future relief. 
Until.... 5-htp. 
I am extremely aware that everyone reacts differently to different chemicals, but for me, it has been a godsend. I take 2 x 100 casuals at night, and from day 3 onward, I have literally never felt better.
 I sleep, have lovely calm dreams (as apposed to constant nightmares), wake up energised & I am happy & completely at peace. 
I have suddenly & completely gone off sugar, and although I am not overweight, I have lost 3 kilos in 2 weeks. 
This would actually be my only warning; if you are someone who struggles to gain & retain weight, I would be careful on 5-htp & force yourself to eat, even if you don't want to. 
Other than that, I have had a 100% positive experience with no side effects whatsoever, & I would encourage anyone who has depression to give this supplement a chance.

I started it after my boyfriend died unexpectedly and I fell into a severe depression (normally I suffer from mild depression). I didn’t have insurance, and started researching alternatives to SSRIs. I had taken Zoloft for a spell years ago and it worked for me okay (though I didn’t like the side effects). The day I started taking it it worked! I was able to get out of bed and do the dishes, a major accomplishment at that time in my life. Over time and with an increased dosage, my depression and anxiety lifted and my concentration and focus improved. It also helped my sleep, and I didn’t experience a decreased libido like I did on Zoloft.

My advice:

1) Work with your doctor if you want to try this. Do not take 5-HTP with other meds unless instructed by your doctor as this can cause bad interactions (e.g., see #3 -serotonin syndrome).

2) Start with a low dose and work your way up. I started with 50 mg. Over time I upped it by 50 mg increments until I found what worked for me (150 mg once a day). 

3) Serotonin Syndrome (where getting too much serotonin is toxic) is real, but from what I have read you have to take 300 mg or more before you see toxic effects. This information may change over time as research teases this out, and I suspect it differs depending on the person. 

4) Take an enterically-coated version of 5-HTP. This means it breaks down in the intestine and not the stomach. After a year or so of taking uncoated pills, I started to experience stomach rumbling and discomfort, and a low-grade fever. The enteric pills eliminated this issue. 

5) Get a good quality product to ensure you are getting a pure product. I take Solaray. 

6) If it makes you sleepy, take it at night. I initially tried it on a Saturday day, when I knew I’d have the day off and could see how it made me feel. It made me drowsy. I now take it ~45 minutes before bed and that’s worked well for me.",171

I had no idea when it would happen and it was scary. I stopped taking the 5-HTP and all of these symptoms stopped. I really wanted to be able to take this because I felt so much better and I believe my family noticed the improvement in mood. My dose was 50 mg per day.

I suffer from moderate to severe depression at times, and can only 50 mg for about 3-4 days before I start suffering from anxiety.  Then I'm good for weeks.  Take your 5-htp...not too much...for whatever amt of days. As soon as you start getting s/e's, this is your threshold. Do not take again till the benefits wear off.

I am noticeably brighter, less negative, more motivated, able to move about quicker and exercise, and my over-appetite and over-sleeping have gone.

In addition, I have felt a bit of a seratonin ""high"", which is great but I have to adjust to my new emotions as that extra self-confidence could spill over into irritability or feeling more confident expressing inner emotions.  It is not as severe as hypomania, but there is definitely a lift in mood that is a shock to the system.  However, I will give it time because I would rather be like this than feeling dull, flabby and sleepy, any day!

WATCH YOUR DOSAGE!!!   I cut a 100 mg tab into quarters and take only 1 daily, with very rare taking 2, so that is only 25mg daily normally.    Great treatment, but the dosage may be what causes so many of the problems people describe.   Who ever said that 100mg was a 'correct' dosage so that so many people take it as a minimum??!!??    And taking multiple dosages, or multiple times daily....talk about too much of a good thing!!!   Get a pill cutter, or split your capsules.  

I can feel the impact of the treatment within 10-20 min, calming my anxiety.    I usually take around noon.   Have GAD and have had panic attacks.    Xanax was horrible.  Dropped it quickly....thank God.   Since starting this 5htp treatment, and taking some GABA only at bedtime which I added to the mix about a year ago, no panic attacks at all.  Anxiety, but no panic.    

I do take 10-15mg amitryp at bedtime, which is a VERY SMALL dose, not therapuetic accoridng to Doc, but am very careful still with 5htp and the ami.    Never taken together at same time or too close together.

Bending over at the waste to pick my pen off the floor made me so dizzy I fell to my knees.  Walking down the stairs is frightening and there is no way I would attempt to drive.  I suppose I could have a bug.  I'm not sure if I should take the pill tonight or just skip it.  As a side bar, my husband started taking 5HTP the same day I started also for insomnia and winter blahs.  He never had tenitis before but his ears started ringing after 3 days.  He stopped taking it immediately but unfortunately still has tenitis!  ",13

Normally, I felt hazy and sluggish which started to be a real problem as I began school at a prestigious college. After the first day of taking 5htp I felt more focused and alert. It acted like a stimulant for me and I even had trouble sleeping the first few weeks. However, others have told me it had the opposite effect on them so I hypothesize that it depends on your already existing serotonin levels. 
I did experience headaches at first but they have now gone away. This did concern me an I would like to know more about the cause.
I also ate less at first, but I now seem to be normalized. It wasn't like being on Ritalin or Adderall where you feel shaky and  the idea of food is repulsive. It's very subtle and you only eat when hungry without overdoing it. 
Overall, 5htp has been a great medication for me. I feel less anxious and with it, I was able to make speeches in public without the crippling fear I had before. ",38

There was a scare about 5HTP in 1988 due to a contaminated batch from Japan, coming from the labs of Showa Denko caused 37 deaths and 1500 permanent disablements. 
Controversy at the time between big pharmas, the biotech and FDA resulted in a blanket ban of 5HTP. Pharmas would rather sell you the more expensive SSRI's. Biotech don't want you to know it was Genetic Engineering caused the problem. FDA played safe and banned everything just in case, or maybe under direction from lobbying by big P & BT.
User consensus says 5-HTP is very helpful, and videos on youtube from qualified professionals saying so. 
Me? I found it immensely helpful and get mine from a reputable source. 
If I hear that ""voice of depression"" I take 2 x 50mg tablets of 5 hydroxy tryptophan in the evening, it gives me a great night's sleep, possibly because it also converts to melatonin and significantly elevates my mood in the morning, presumably due to increased serotonin levels. 
I wish WebMD would update their statement to ""avoid"" this very helpful food supplement, and stop misleading people who need help, but they have not responded to my attempts to contact them with links about the original 5HTP contamination. 
Don't cross medicate with SSRI's or MAOI's and it is probably perfectly safe. 
Look up Tryptophan poisoning on google for yourself.

I had been reading about 5-HTP and seeing the results from comments such as below have been having on peoples lives so decided to try for myself.. what did I have to lose right.. ? My MD had scribed Xanax for me... but it was really causing me to detach from life altogether.. 

I was at Costo last week and found Natrol 5-HTP - although dubious yet excited.. I tried the product and have been taking it for a week.. 

Well I honestly have to say.. WOW.. what a difference... No more Mr Snapper Head and now I am feeling like ""normal"".. I have no idea how it performs on appetite control as I am a foodie.. but I can say without a doubt that my mood has lifted and I am out of my funk and thats after 1 week.. I have found that the stupid small stuff in life that would occupy my mind for no reason at all has pretty much gone.. I have started to accept things for what they are and move on.. instead of dwelling and festering on things.. 
So - my opinion - for what it is worth.. go to Costco or the drug store - try it for yourself.. I think you will see a difference.. as so many people like myself have.

I have begun taking 50 mg of 5-htp every other night along with a multi vitamin and fish oil daily. Of course, I have also done behavioral cognitive therapy and have seen a social worker but I have noticed an amazing difference in my depression and my anxiety has almost completely lifted. I am sleeping again. I feel like myself again only better. I am happy and I truly think it was all of these things put together but 5-htp had alot to do with it.  

I will say that I am 24 years old and am 5'3, 120 lbs. The first afternoon I took 100 mg and it was way too much for me. But the side effects were still not as bad as the antidepressents. I do currently still get headaches almost everyday; however, the duration and severity has improved. Hopefully at some point, these will go away too! But I'll take an aching headache over my previous symptoms anyday. ",97

I have taken Celexa, Wellbutrin (for 2 days, it made me physically ill to the point where I couldn't function!!), Prozac and Lexapro.  The Celexa and Prozac both worked well for about 6 months, and then tapered off.  Increasing the dose had the same effect after a few months.  I weaned myself off the Prozac (with my doctor's approval) during the spring and summer months, and found that with the use of 5 HTP I didn't need to go back on it in the fall for seasonal affective disorder.  At one point I was out of my 5 HTP supplement for about a month, and EVERYONE noticed how much my moods were affected!!!  I felt exhausted, miserable, angry and sad, like having permanent PMS!!!  Within a week of returing to my regular 5 HTP doe, I felt so much better and more in control of my emotions.  I felt normal!!!  This supplement has really been a God-send for me and my loved ones.  It feels great to not be on any antidepressant meds, and to feel good about myself not requiring the medication anymore.  I strongly urge anyone who has depression issues to look into 5 HTP therapy.  It can be used in conjunction with some traditional medications, but you need to check with your doctor.  Please do your research prior to taking any supplement.

NO BS.... I noticed a difference after the first week. 1600 mg/day. Within a month probably @ 50? improvement (I quit taking Gabapentin at this point). 3 months saw @ 90% improvement (dosage here was reduced to 1200 mg/day). 6 months @ 95? better (dosage reduced to 800mg/day).

After just over a year at a dose of 800mg/day my pn is (depending on the day) between 98%-100% gone!!!! It is summer of 2016 and I have spent a significant amount of time walking around barefoot outdoors. I can wear any shoe I want, even my footwear of choice, cowboy boots. I even got my first ever pedicure a couple weeks ago. 

You have nothing to lose, so try it, I sure hopes it does for you what it did for me. Probably the only reason I am taking the time to write this is that after it was recommended to me in that Dr. office I reseached ALA and these reviews made me decide to give it a try. I hope you find relief and pain free days. Peace, Kenny ",32

Who asked how can you tell if ALA is working.
1) Monitor your blood sugar for a week WITHOUT the ALA.
2) Take ALA as suggested for a week and monitor your blood sugar.
See if your blood sugar has gone down or if any of your symptoms are better (though it's too early to really tell but some people actually get early results)
3) Keep taking ALA til the bottle runs out.
Check your blood sugar levels til ALA runs out. 
If A) Your blood sugar levels go down, then the ALA is working.
B) If your blood sugar doesn't go down BUT you see improvement in any of your symptoms,
continue with the ALA. Check to see how long it's safe to take ALA. Keep taking ALA for as long (length of time) as said to be safe.
Hope this helps those who want to know.

When first using it, it has a more powerful and noticeable effect, where I wake up in the morning feeling very peaceful and refreshed compared to usual. Eventually, if I keep taking it, it has a lot less of that effect. I take breaks from it for a few weeks after using it nightly for a few months to a year, because of a concern that it competes with the B-vitamin biotin, which has strong value for one's health. I take biotin every day earlier in the day away from the lipoic. I have tried using lipoic in conjunction with heavy metal detox protocols (modified citrus pectin and/or chlorella and/or cilantro in my green veggie juices, etc.) because the research behind that is, as I understand it, quite sound and convincing if done the right way. Should not be used too early in the program if one is definitely laden with mercury, because it can mobilize Hg in a way that it may bring more INTO the brain instead of removing it. For that purpose, should be used after a lot of whole body Hg detox has taken place first over a long period of time, and THEN use it every 3 hours I believe (might have been 2.5) to help remove some mercury.

I've been taking R-Alpha Lipoic Acid, from Jarrows, for quite some time for type 2 diabetes and diabetic neuropathy.  Recently a mix-up occurred and I wasn't putting it with my daily pills.  I also use a fentanyl duragesic patch and a strong hydromorphone dose for breakthrough pain for this and other issues.  

I have a LOT of prescriptions to manage, so missing one pill is easy.  I had to take more and more hydromorphone to get any relief from my neuropathy, which was unusual, but a few hours later I'd be hurting again.  After a couple weeks I was literally starting to get desperate so we went through my pills and found the missing bottle of Alpha Lipoic Acid.  I took a couple that morning, and I was back to normal by the afternoon!

Now don't get it in your head that if you take it just when you have a neuropathy flare-up that you will get instant improvement -- maybe it helped me so fast since I took it for so long, but who knows.  I can't recommend it enough though -- strong painkillers barely helps neuropathy, but this stuff works fantastic.

I have no idea if it's true or not, but you should try and get the ""active"" version of Alpha Lipoic so that your body can use it immediately.  I use a 100 mg dose of the Jarrow R-ALA morning and evening for neuropathy, which runs me about $17 a month when I buy them from Amazon.

Seriously, try it.  Take it for a month and see if you notice your nerve pain go away.  If not, then stop taking it ... and see if you notice it then.  I sure as heck did...

Note that I can't find Jarrow Formula's on the product brand, but hopefully the one I chose is close enough.  Search Amazon for Jarrow Formulas R-Alpha Lipoic Acid and that should do it too.",5

But, I have another medication I can take for that and the anxiety makes me exercise to burn it off, so...mostly worth it for the pain reduction from arthritis.

2002,20,4/28/2014 11:59:39 PM,Hot flashes,45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Consumer),5,5,4,"I've had horrifying and constant night sweats and day time hot flashes for over two months. The night sweats were the worst. As soon as I put my head on the pillow, I'd feel it coming on and I'd be freezing/shaking, hot, and absolutely drenched, going through many articles of clothing, blankets, sheets. I was absolutely exhausted and at my wits end. 

My doctor recommended black cohosh and I purchased the 540mg tabs and take twice a day. At first this dosage confused me as I felt it was a bit high, but it is NOT the extract. Still, it did the trick. The first week, little relief, week two NO day time hot flashes and only minor feeling of warmth, only to roll over and go to sleep and slept all through the night. Due to chronic illness that I have, sleep is critical to my health. I could feel myself falling apart with the night sweats, literally crying in frustration, having to get up every hour or two and change everything. 

This stuff was a miracle for me. I experience heartburn and some other odd side effects but I am on other medications. I have done a drug interactions checker against this supplement and my meds. You can do this online. 
Anyway, the side effects that are minor are far easier to live with, than the night sweats that were ruining my life and dangerously affecting my health. I'm sorry to read stories of those where this product was dangerous or did not work. 

I am NOT a big supporter of supplements, but desperation won out this time. Supplements usually do nothing for me, but this one sold me. 

I highly recommend at least a try, but NOT without talking to your doctor, checking it against all your other meds/supplements and paying close attention to any side effects you may have. Good Luck! ",68

My doctor recommended increasing my soy intake, and if I had night sweats to use the spare bed.  Using the dry bed to return to sleep & to flip over when I saturated one side & get on the other. By then, my sheets would be dry and I could return to my own bed! Not quite the fix I had in mind.

The following day the hives started again. This time on my arm. So I went to my family doctor, who also advised me of an allergic reactions to something, and gave me an RX. for for steriod tablets.(which I couldn't pick up until the next day). When I got home from the doctor's office I took black cohosh again. Later that evening my hands started swelling to the point I had to take off my rings, I started feeling nauseated, and my lips started to swell. I went to urgent care. They gave me another shot of steriod. When I woke up the next day my hands were still swollen.

No period for 1 year, definitely menopause. Perimeno was filled with night sweats, hot flushes and mood swings. I eat barely any processed foods and tried yams and tofu to boost my diet with respect to the symptoms. I drink no alcohol, 2 cups strong coffee daily. When having a hot flush, I followed some blessed woman's advice and out an ice pack on the back of my neck. A Godsend if that's available out of home.
In June 2011, after suffering this for 4.5 years, I discovered Menolieve at Boots in the UK. 6.5 mg, once daily around 3pm. What a difference! My flushes are reduced to 2 mins instead of the usual 10, occurrences have reduced by 75%, I don't feel like a furnace, and the night sweats are nearly gone. Mood swings? Gone.
With respect to headaches, ab cramps, etc., felt by others, perhaps the dosage is too high. I started small enough such that if I couldn't rid the flushes completely, I could double up for a week and see how that went. I do notice more sweating during but I'll take that tradeoff any day given how quickly it dissipates.
All in all, I'm grateful I stepped out of my comfort zone of no drugs, no herbs, not even an aspirin and gave this a try.

My mother had been using it daily to ease migraine headaches for several years. My migraines were blinding, puking pain for hours up to days. Sometimes I would get background headaches that would be on and off for several days. So we tried taking butterbur as soon as I got any early warning symptoms. Almost invariably, if I take it within half an hour of early symptoms, the migraine stops completely within 15 minutes. More than 3/4 of the time, if I take it after early warning, when the full headache starts, the migraine intensity is lessened significantly. Often, this is the difference between days of pain, and sleeping at night.
I don't take it every day as a preventative, just when I get symptoms or know I will be around a lot of triggers.
I've never needed to get other medicine prescribed for migraines, since this works so well.",56

Because beans haven't begun development yet they contain primarily simple compounds. Tea however is derived from a leaf. Leaves are complex factories that produce hundreds of compounds... one of which is Theanine. This compound counters the bad effects of Caffeine (more or less depending on leaf content). As a result Tea should be considered different from other drinks. Also if consumed as a whole leaf either steeped multiple times (Chinese method known as Gongfu) Tea  provides huge doses of antioxidents with decreasing levels of Caffeine allowing Tea to “Wake you in the morning, keep you throughout the day, and put you to sleep soundly at night.” This due to decreasing Caffeine, and the “soporific” (sleep inducing) effect of  Theanine.",2

I think it speaks for itself. I was told by my gasterointerologist that it is a great laxative. Just a word to the weary about that, I'm not sure how accurate the side effects page on this is listing diarrhea as a ""rare"" side effect, but I suppose the days where insomnia is your only company and the next day of work mocks you for it, on those days it's worth putting up with the less than pleasant side effects for the ability to stay up and get the job done. Just remember to back off the stuff when your hands start shaking, figure out how long it takes to get through your system and space out the caffeine in those intervals to avoid overdose. for me it's about 2-3 hours. Body weight plays a factor, I happen to be a lean man in his mid 20's, so you may have separate circumstances. It is easy to build up a tolerance similar to alcohol requiring substantially more to get the same effect. This also creates a chemical dependency that can cause migraines when your brain is deprived of it. I avoid this by putting up with the migraines for a few days and avoid caffeinated food and supplements for up to 3 months. After that time I generally have brought my brain's chemical dependency to next to nil and my tolerance back down to healthier levels.

Always in moderation, and remember, never do any physically demanding activities when you've taken caffeine, it reduces lung capacity and robs your muscles of nutrients causing them to fatigue very fast under strain. You can create heart problems if you are under it's effects and subject your heart to too much strain, your base heart rate is already elevated and the extra strain can be painful to endure.",24

I am a 60 year old female, and I have been taking co-Q-10 supplements daily for over 20 years.  I began taking it after reading a research paper that indicated that co-Q-10 might be effective in increasing immune response.  My whole life prior to that time, I was extremely susceptible to infections; if someone with the flu or a cold even looked at me across a room, I got sick.  I was constantly sick as a child, and as an adult suffered what seemed like a continuous cold throughout the winter, along with episodes of the flu, bronchitis, etc.  NOTHING helped, not dietary intervention, not the then-popular vitamin C dosage, nothing.  After several months of taking a combined dose of co-Q-10, vitamin E and lecithin (a cocktail suggested in the research paper), I noticed that I was not getting sick as often.  I have continued the same dosage since that time, and I have not had a single cold while taking it.  No colds, no flu, no bronchitis, nothing. I did suspend the dosage for several weeks two or three times, to see if it made a difference.  It did.  Caught a cold.  Started dosage again and returned to cold-free status. (I should note that after reading reports earlier this year that long-term dosage with vitamin E could be harmful, I discontinued the vitamin E portion of the cocktail.  I have not noticed any decrease in effectiveness).   So I am curious to know if there have been any further studies on this effect of co-Q-10.  Is it possible that this could be a placebo effect of such lasting duration?  What say you, experts?  Inquiring minds want to know. ^_^

This specific type of Ubiguinol has relieved all my symptoms. I started at 50mg with no change then to 100mgs with significate relief. I believe the initial problem started because of a statin drug I was taking and I assumed if I stopped taking the statin the muscle pain and weakness would stop but it didn't. As this was unusal I researched looking for anything I could do to relieve the muscle problem and Ubiquinol(Kaneka QH) worked. I since have talked to my doctor and was recommended I increase the dose to 200mgs as I am going to try another statin drug for my high cholesterol. I am also having additional testing for any other condition that may have caused the muscle pain and weakness after stopping the statin.

Unfortunately, since most sufferers prefer to go to their doctors and have strong drugs prescribed against migraines, access to feverfew has diminished, and many drug stores no longer carry it. I would highly recommend feverfew against migraines - a natural herb that has been used for century and still does the job wonderfully. Anna C. ",42

Fish oil works by reducing inflammation in the brain on a sub-cellular level which allows the neurotransmitters in the brain to be able function more efficiently without misfiring (which is believed to be the cause of many mood disorders).

Regardless if you're suffering general anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, or any number off issues, fish oil will only help.

Be sure to read the label, just because it says 1000 mg on the bottle means very little.  What is important are how many mg of actual omega 3s are in each capsule.  Most drug store brands have about 300mg of omega 3s and to be effective for mood disorders, you need 2000-3000 mgs of omega 3s daily.  Specifically EPA.

I hope this helps ..",6

I have low blood pressure, chlorestorel is fine. I have been taking iron, 150 mg for over two years. Everytime I stop taking it, my iron levels plummet. If fish oil prevents blood clotting, ie thickening of blood,and can cause bleeding from the liver,, would taking this krill oil be causing me to lose iron? Just wanted to chime in with my theory. I think Ill stop taking it for awhile. The body doesnt need much fat. Hormones are made from chlorestorel. But think of the body as mostly water. What happens when you put oil, in water? It floats. Think of your blood. Basically, the oil is greasing up your blood. I have read studies about vit e and estrogen that state estrogen is inactive until activated by e, e is an oil. when activated by the wrong oil, it can trigger cancer. I even wonder if the body needs ANY external oils at all. This states that the omegas are not naturally made in the body. Then why supplument them?

There's no *perceptible* difference that I can feel, and the very latest research from Yale, where the scientists combed through all the studies, is that the studies just don't show a connection between ingestion of EPA/DHA and relief of bipolar or depressive symptoms.  Michael Bloch's team at Yale found that there was no *meaningful* connection between use of DPA/EHA and these disorders.  (The article: Mol Psychiatry. 2012 Dec;17(12):1272-82. doi: 10.1038/mp.2011.100. Epub 2011 Sep 20.).

Then again, the research does indicate that omega-3s are helpful for cardiac pathology, and certainly they don't *harm* you, so I'm going to keep taking them.  I'm just going to be careful not to spend a fortune on them, and not to ignore other treatment options and put all my eggs in the Omega-3 basket.

The IBS slowly got worse to the point where I was tested for celiac disease and gluten intolerance - negative on both fronts. The IBS got to the point where I was having up to ten BM's a day - not diarrhea, just constantly in the bathroom. It was miserable -it was hard to go out for even a few hours. It actually caused me to change jobs from a 70% travel position to an inside position. I saw the 2013 NEJM data on the ineffectiveness of fish oil in cardiac conditions, saw my doc and told him I was going to discontinue the fish oil because it wasn't doing anything for the triglycerides and I saw no long term benefit. 4 weeks later ALL my IBS symptoms were gone. I told my doc and he was as shocked as I was - he'd never seen delayed onset IBS with fish oil. So if you have developed IBS in fish oil, talk to your doc and tell him that it can happen.

Last year, it was so bad that it went deeper than the skin and ate into my flesh in one spot...leaving a scar that's still there today. This year, it itches very little, the rash isn't very raised, and as I said, absolutely no blisters.

And finally, a 2nd bleed following routine outpatient inguinal hernia surgery performed laporoscopically (suspicion of nicked artery during surgery - received 2 units of blood). I was not even thinking about ED when I started taking Arginine so we can safely rule out a placebo effect.  Taking only 2 grams of Arginine per day, I still experienced a distinct ED improvement - I wasn't back in my 20s but I was certainly more functional.  But the best benefit was a virtual end of the angina which I was experiencing a few times per month.  I also noticed a slight improvement of my musculature without any additional exercise on my part.

I take these right before bed when I take my magnesium (because both give me putrid gas for several hours).  This is a side effect not mentioned on the labels of either product.  FYI.  But this it is the only adverse side effect I’ve noticed that I have!  The combination of these two supplements has really improved my mood and overall sense of well being.  Anxiety and negative thinking is now rare and very short lived.  I no longer feel bloated because the digestive tract and bowels are moving, and I have more energy and a positive outlook.  I am amazed that probiotics can actually improve your mental acuity, focus and sense of well being!  Everybody should take these! Read about the immune system and how it effects EVERYTHING in the human body, especially the digestive system, heart and brain!  When I started using magnesium WITH high quality probiotics (I also am very self aware of my stress levels) my old self came back, but a better version.  A healthy diet with exercise make this work even better!",71

I didn't have depression, anxiety, or any mood disorder; apart from the hair-pulling, I was completely healthy. After stopping Abilify cold-turkey (my doctor at the time told me this would be okay; she was WAY wrong), I experienced an intense 5-day-long anxiety attack.  Just constant panic, depression, crying, and depersonalization. On day 5, the ""episode"" ended just as suddenly as it began.

Ever since then, I'd have weeks of normalcy--even a slight euphoria--and then about 3 days of anxiety and depression that would, again, start without warning, and end just as suddenly.  Sometimes it was 3 days, sometimes more; sometimes it was so bad I couldn't function. Some episodes were more mild, but still very disrupting my life. I also began to pull more hair than ever.

I saw many doctors and was diagnosed with everything from General Anxiety, to Postpartum Depression (I gave birth a year ago), to Bipolar disorder. I knew in my heart the Abilify had caused this, somehow.

I read in a few forums about people having great success with TwinLab Amino Fuel, L-glutamine powder, and magnesium (all three taken together in the mornings on an empty stomach--I take 40 mL, 1 teaspoon, and 250 mg, respectively). I decided to give it a try, since I was desperate, and Abilify had scared me off psychiatric drugs permanently.

Within a week, I felt a LOT better. I started taking another 250 mg magnesium before bed, and now (2 months later) I feel even better, almost 100%. I do get ""twinges"" of anxiety now and then, but they are so mild and fleeting, I barely notice them; on these days I take an extra magnesium midday. I know the other supplements are helping a lot too, but the magnesium is great just by itself. It feels like I have my life back!! Highly recommend no matter what kind of anxiety you have.",73

I take a 1,000 mg twice a day and it helps with feeling less stressed as well.

IT WORKS.

But Big Pharma cannot control it, so therefore it is ""POSSIBLY SAFE"".

What a crock.

Indians have used it FOR CENTURIES.

'Big Pharma' RUINED my heart. 2 med' were mixed by a doctor who SHOULD NOT BE PRACTICING - 20+ Malpractice suits pending - but he goes on and on.

I got  antibiotic colitis, was told ""it was all my head"", and ended up with persistent atrial fibrillation. I pro-tennis athlete with ZERO heart history.

Long story short, segue 6 years LATER when I was FINALLY ably to receive treatment. My Ejection Fraction was down to 27/28%!!!

They asked if I could GET OUT OF A CHAIR, UNAIDED! I still had to work, teach, and play tennis LIKE THIS!

The cutoff for an Ablation (I wanted to start simple - not MAZE, Pacemaker, etc) was an E/F of 35%.

The surgeon told me there was ""no way"" to raise my E/F.

Started researching, and discovered a heart study with Pycnogenol.

45 days later, final Echo.

36%.

A 30% INCREASE.

Numbness? Tingling? At night, laying down?

Mine was increasing DESPITE a very successful Ablation.

Restarted Pyc', 3 x 360mg, spread out through the day.

Numbness and tingling (and right foot being colder) have dissipated to almost nothing.

My doctors are like 'ho hum', or ""hmmmmm"", but since THERE IS NO KICKBACK AS THERE IS IN ALL THE HIGH-END PHARMACEUTICALS?

You won't EVER hear about it.

Which is also why Big Pharma wants to make most 'alternative' (read: NATURAL) medicine ILLEGAL.

Trust me; If they can ban this stuff? It will come back, on TV, with a catchy little tune...PYTESTOLLLLLLL....la la la....

At $500+ a month.

I purchased a skin serum with Pycnogenol as the primary ingredient. The intended use of the serum was to calm and soothe the easily irritated skin on my face. Certain foods & environmental factors make my skin very red and inflamed, and this product claimed to help with my symptoms. Unfortunately (and shame on me) I didn't realize that Pycnogenol is derived from Pine trees. I tested positive for ""Pine Mix"" during my allergy screening but never ""put two and two together"" when using this face serum. It took me about a month of being miserable, a trip to my allergy doctor, and tons of blood work to realize that the serum was making my allergies WAY worse. The primary adverse reaction that I had was dry mouth and subtle swelling of my tongue, which was very scary. It also seemed that while using this serum (twice/ day,) I was more sensitive to other foods/ environmental factors that set off my allergies.
In my opinion, if you have any kind of sensitivity to Pine, you should stay away from this ingredient.",11

However, a year ago I began experiencing issues with peripheral vascular disease associated with varicose veins (ulcerations and subcutaneous bleeding on my calves, joint pain and stiffness, planar fasciitis and chronic leg cramps). 

Within weeks of treating my varicose veins with compression stockings and elevation, I noted increased postural tachycardia, which became debilitating after 3 months (could no longer work). While waiting to see my PCP, I came off the melatonin and both my tachycardia and varicose veins began improving significantly. Three weeks after discontinuing its use, the tachycardia disappeared and the varicose veins improved enough to allow me to go without compressions stockings for intervals of several hours.

Have found nothing to explain the correlation but for a study in European Journal of Phramocology, vol 345, 1 March 1998 (NIH medical journal database), where the authors discuss the presence of MT1 & MT2 receptors (to which melatonin binds) in smooth muscle of vascular tissue and their role in vasodilation and constriction, respectively, as an explanation for melatonin’s systemic efficacy.

While my overall condition improved when I discontinued use, I did experience a brief period of cognitive impairment and an uptick in mean blood pressure, the latter of which may require me to seek treatment should it persist. Finally have a follow-up with a cardiologist.

But the problem is, each brand and dose of melatonin (and possibly each ""batch"") is SO different. A few brands have worked consistently better than prescription sleep aids for me, but unfortunately MOST brands are either ineffective, or produce the opposite effect desired (eg, I needed a Xanax to counteract the nervous, gittery feelings, then I still couldn't sleep but at least I wasn't jittery.)

One 3mg brand I like is pretty consistent for me (and $3/month! cheap!), but the same brand has a few other doses, plus a ""dissolvable"" 3mg dose with sweetening added, and of course all the bottles look the same, so I've accidentally bought the wrong ones (or if the right ones were sold out, tried another dose): ALL the other doses of the ""good brand"" didn't work. And the sugary one gave me the ""nervousness"" effect.

After a few YEARS of trying melatonin for sleep (on and off), though I have a decent one now, I really think the FDA should be looking at what these vitamin companies put into these pills. At least there should be consistency from ""batch to batch"" (same brand/dose).

So when you hit luck with a good one, it's very effective. But it really feels like a crapshoot when you open the next bottle. I'd love to put my brand/dose as 5-star satisfaction, but since this review is just ""melatonin"", I've got to consider the rest of my experiences with melatonin. Mostly positive, but even the few times I've gotten ""the jitters"" ...why package and sell a sleep aid that makes insomnia a nightmare? It makes it tempting to go back to prescription meds (where the FDA at least has a say).",69

I like that it is not addictive. I particularly like it when my schedule is irregular and I need to get to bed earlier than normal for an early am appointment. It gets you sleepy in about 20 mins. (of course it's best to start settling down for the evening). It is a dream enhancer though, the higher the dose as in 5-10mg the more one will tend to dream. This can make one feel as though they haven't slept. Best to start with a small dose and increase until you find a dosage that makes you sleepy in the 20 min range. Then go to bed. If you don't your body will just work it through and it will do no good. I also like to combine this with Valerian root which produces a sound sleep. Also non addictive. One of each on any given work night is about the right dose for me.  The melatonin dose is 1mg and the valerian is 500 mg.  I have taken up to 10 mg of melatonin with no ill effects, however you will need 8-11 hours of sleep with that dosage and you may still wake up groggy.

I've tried a number of brands of melatonin, but many don't work. I've settled on Natrol, because it works. There are probably others that work also, but I haven't seen any reason to experiment unless/until the Natrol becomes unavailable or stops working. Remember that these are not manufactured as drugs and there is no required test for what's in the tablet. If the first brand doesn't work for  you, try others until you find one. That doesn't mean you will necessarily succeed - melatonin doesn't work for everybody. Try it, though. Start with low doses and adjust as you see how it affects you. Good luck!",54

3676,35,4/28/2014 9:01:30 PM,Benzodiazepine withdrawal,"John shepherd, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months",3,5,3,"Benzodiazepines cause tolerance and physical dependence within two to four weeks, and, upon cessation acute withdrawal traditionally requires tapered management. Additionally in some long term users experience withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal syndrome can last many months and is typified by a major depressive episode, agitation, and lack of ability to get to sleep. This is a serious side effect which needs careful monitoring.
ol
For this reason Benzodiazepines need to be used with extreme caution and for very short periods.

Melatonin is effective for sleep disturbances that are not caused by an over active nervous system, such is in the case of Benzodiazepine withdrawal. It appears virtually ineffective during acute (tapered) withdrawal, although somewhat helpful during withdrawal syndrome. For this reason it's main purpose during withdrawal is an adjunct with other therapies.

To my knowledge Melatonin does not effect the calcium channels that have been disturbed by benzodiazepine usage and this is why, in my view, Melatonin is not very effective on it's own as an Anxiolytic (antianxiety agent.)

My experience is that SSRI's are not very effective for use for withdrawal, however responses to SSRI's are individual dependant.

It is essential to manage benzodiazepine withdrawal and protracted withdrawal syndrome using a variety of methods including CBT, but most effectively, using an alternative Anxiolytic, the most effective of which is Phenibut (CALMEXA).

Phenibut Calmexa is GABA with a phenyl ring that allows it to pass the blood brain barrier, therefore replacing the GABA depleted by benzodiazepine dependence. With medical management it can safely and entirely replace the use of Benzodiazepines, causing an alternative dependence both easier to taper with less risk of protracted withdrawal syndrome. 

Melatonin used together with Phenibut is very effective for inducing sleep, establishing and maintaining a sleeping pattern.

Trouble falling and staying asleep. Erratic work schedule. I use melatonin infrequently but with extremely high doses (ie used 20mg last night). Result: vivid dreams, but it helps to keep me asleep.

I take 3mg of melatonin approximately mid-day to advance my sleep phase.  The timing needs to be precise in relationship to my internal body clock, which is not always easy to know.  If I wake after an hour of heavy dream sleep, my waking time is a reliable marker and I will take melatonin eight hours later.  If I hit the right timing window, I'll have fairly strong fatigue within an hour.  This lasts for a couple of hours.  I can't do certain kinds of work in this state, but I can do housework and listen to lectures.  I call it my stupid pill, but it doesn't actually make me stupid, but impairs my ability to generate outward focus.  Missing my window even once can make it hard to recover the required timing accuracy.  The difference is profound.  I can tell I miss the window because I have far less fatigue.  Taking coffee at the same time as the melatonin significantly reduces fatigue, but it also made the treatment less reliable.  Used to have an ""all nighter"" without fail at least once every three weeks for twenty years.  In my first year on melatonin, I lost control only three times and had to flip over.  Variability in the potency messed me up on one of those.  One vendor didn't work at all.  Another vendor works well most of the time, but some bottles aren't all there.  Think I get mild stomach irritation at night, nothing really to complain about, and it could be other things in the pill.  My life is spectacularly better since I discover this, having found the research myself.  Would love to find a 100% consistent formulation.

She only needs them occasionally instead of having to take otc for weeks at a time . We get the caps from dr. vitamin store online $15 for 600 standardized extract to 42 mgs of oleuropein . If you have sinus pain taking 1 or 2 500mgs caps of bromelain on empty stomach does the trick. Olive leaf is nondrowzy . Bromelain could make you a little drowsy but when taken together with OL seem to have no side effects. Somebody needs to make gummys out of this stuff! Supplements are great.

Many ingredients are industrial processed, used in most foods today and using a migraine prescription med is not safe everyday, and causes rebound migraines.

I would urge anyone who takes large amounts of one particular B vitamin to also take a good B-complex, as all B-vitamins need to work together. High levels of just Riboflavin used for a prolonged period of time can lead to cataracts. Butterbur works well, as does Feverfew. My research and personal experience shows that some people do not tolerate B-vitamins that are not methylated. Malabsorption of B2, B6, B9 and B12 can lead to high homocysteine levels in the body, which become toxic and are responsible for migraines and other unpleasant conditions. Google ""methylated B vitamins,"" and see that the inability of a person to methylate their B6, B9 and B12 can be genetic and run in families. Luckily, it is possible nowadays to find B-vitamin complexes in which those components are already methylated for us. It is advisable for people with these genetic markers to stop taking vitamin B complexes that contain unmethylated B6, B9, and B12, as it will destroy the delicate new balance. With this regime, which does include Riboflavin, I am not only keeping migraines at bay, but have stopped having food and environmental allergies (PABA works for the latter) and my digestion is much improved.",46

Most reviewers here and on Amazon take 400 mg a day. I say start small. I take 200 mg (2 pills) a day on first break with FOOD. Food prevents upset stomach associated with taking vitamins. I also drink it down with Emergen-C. 

That's all! After a week up it if it doesn't feel like enough. 

I have been doing this for over a year and have only had one brief migraine - 2 weeks ago. I don't take it on the weekends because breakfast isn't routine for me on weekends. I do occasionally get a mild headache on a weekend here and there and will remember to take the B2. It goes away pretty quick.

No noticeable side effects. Yes, neon urine! 

Definitely an Affordable option other migraine sufferers should check out. 

I love the TwinLabs capsules because they are small (very small). Even if you had to take four, no problem! 

I will probably have to take these for life! Small price compared to the chemicals the doctors will prescribe and what they will do to your body 10 years from now.

I hope this helps!

The Lexapro seemed to help a little with my anxiety, but did nothing for the depression. The Wellbutrin just felt like speed, which I am pretty sure that it is an amphetamine. It did not seem to help with my depression at all, aside from giving me a little more energy. I have taken St. John's wort many times in my life, and as long as I remembered to take it on a fairly regular basis, it lifted my spirits and improved my outlook on life tremendously. I am so grateful to know about this herb. I often take ginko biloba with it in addition to a healthy dose of fish oil daily. I always say that it makes me feel like myself again! And that feels good!
   My problem is that once I really start feeling well again, I begin to start forgetting to take my supplements on a regular basis, because I don't ""need"" them anymore. And then eventually, I stop taking them altogether and somewhere down the line, I end up depressed and where I started again. I'm sure if I had stayed on a regimen of taking my supplements, everything would have been fine.
   The only side effect I had was sensitivity to the sun. I got really sunburned when I went on vacation to Hawaii. So definitely be careful in the sun. I am a freckled Irish girl, so I'm already susceptible ( and stupid, obviously). So wear your sunscreen!!

I've been using St. John's Wort for several years, but I remember the first 6 months of using it daily and feeling as though it was not working. This is a natural plant not altered by chemicals, so expecting it to work like medication is an unreasonable expectation! Secondly, there is more obligation on your behalf than just orally consuming the pill, or tea. First, you have to actually following the instructions on each bottle. (Each one varies!) Next, you have to exhibit some physical activities to help increase your own natural chemicals; therefore, enhancing the Hypericum perforatum effect. I love it and I will never go without it!!! (Unless, chemist begin to try and add other chemicals, like antidepressants and anxieties). Lastly, if you were taking antidepressants or anti anxieties, your body must first completely detox from them and begin to naturally level you chemical imbalances (within your brain). Otherwise, you can expect results to be the same as someone who has used Oxycodone for a year, and randomly decided to use Ibuprofen for the pain.

I couldn't concentrate at work and even whilst relaxing on the sofa in the evening, my stomach was in knots for no reason. I didn't want to see a doctor as from past experiences, one of two things would happen - They would either treat me like a hypochondriac who had nothing wrong with her or they would try to pump me full of prescription drugs which I really didn't want to take as I have seen what depression pills do to people. My partner looked into herbal remedies and came across St John's Wort and I started taking it about 2 weeks ago. After a couple of days, I was feeling so much more relaxed and less anxious. Now a couple of weeks on and I have been so much more positive about life in general. My partner has noticed a big change in me and I have even been trying new things that I wouldn't have done before because I don't have the feeling that something bad is always going to happen. It could be a placebo affect but as far as I am concerned, this product has been life changing. I will slowly wean myself off it in time but for now, St John's Wort is keeping residence in my life. If you are suffering from anxiety or mild depression I would recommend trying this, it might work for you, it might not but if you are feeling that bad then it's worth a try surely. ",20

I had very dark thoughts that were getting worse, very little motivation, no drive or energy, felt hopeless, worthless, and helpless, etc, and my dr suggested that I take an antidepressant, but I wanted to try out an herbal remedy instead. I took one 300mg pill in the morning and began feeling calmer within 3 hours. A sense of well-being and peace filled me entirely. The darkness and depressed thoughts have lifted considerably and I actually find that I can enjoy living. I've been taking 300mg once a day but am thinking of cutting the dose in half and taking it before bed since the pill seems to make me very sleepy during the day and leaves me with a slight headache. So far I've been very satisfied with the product and impressed by how quickly and effectively it worked. My only complaints are the sleepiness and mild headache.

It has helped me alot especially since I am so scared of the side effedts that other medication gave me. I can see a big difference.,21

4207,40,8/12/2008 12:51:54 PM,Other,25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years,4,4,4,"As stated by a previous reviewer, I take St. John's wort and within a short period of time (a hour at least) I notice a difference in my mood. I take it as needed and have been taking it on and off for about a year. It reduces the edge from the many struggles in the day. I have no side affects to report. I have recommended it to family and friends but as we all know, what works for one person may not work for another.",24

So, I tried St. John's Wort... and loved it. You still feel your emotions, but it takes the edge off. You aren't SO sad or SO angry. I feel that it makes me more rational about the issues I am having. 

The only issue I have is that you have to take it so often. I normally forget to take the three daily doses required, but I find my one at breakfast and one at dinner is satisfactory for me. Take with food or you'll be burping all day!

If you are feeling extremes of emotion, I highly suggest taking St. John's Wort.

I saw a significant difference in my mood after only about 1 week.  Side effects for me include slight headaches (which stopped after the first two weeks) and light sensitivity (nothing my sunglasses can't handle).  Although I've never tried other medications, I did not feel the 'numbness' that I've heard others describe when taking certain prescription meds.  In short, I feel like a less irritable, more positive and resilient version of my former self.",57

So I bought some and took it according to directions. It din't seem to do much and after I started using it I started to get headaches which stopped after I stopped taking it.,19
