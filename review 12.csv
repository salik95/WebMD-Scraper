Not including simple mixes such as soda, or ""Red Bull"" like drinks which add caffeine, drinks like Tea, Coffee, and Chocolate (Cocoa) are for the most part derived from simple beans. Because beans haven't begun development yet they contain primarily simple compounds. Tea however is derived from a leaf. Leaves are complex factories that produce hundreds of compounds... one of which is Theanine. This compound counters the bad effects of Caffeine (more or less depending on leaf content). As a result Tea should be considered different from other drinks. Also if consumed as a whole leaf either steeped multiple times (Chinese method known as Gongfu) Tea  provides huge doses of antioxidents with decreasing levels of Caffeine allowing Tea to “Wake you in the morning, keep you throughout the day, and put you to sleep soundly at night.” This due to decreasing Caffeine, and the “soporific” (sleep inducing) effect of  Theanine.",2

I was told by my gasterointerologist that it is a great laxative. Just a word to the weary about that, I'm not sure how accurate the side effects page on this is listing diarrhea as a ""rare"" side effect, but I suppose the days where insomnia is your only company and the next day of work mocks you for it, on those days it's worth putting up with the less than pleasant side effects for the ability to stay up and get the job done. Just remember to back off the stuff when your hands start shaking, figure out how long it takes to get through your system and space out the caffeine in those intervals to avoid overdose. for me it's about 2-3 hours. Body weight plays a factor, I happen to be a lean man in his mid 20's, so you may have separate circumstances. It is easy to build up a tolerance similar to alcohol requiring substantially more to get the same effect. This also creates a chemical dependency that can cause migraines when your brain is deprived of it. I avoid this by putting up with the migraines for a few days and avoid caffeinated food and supplements for up to 3 months. After that time I generally have brought my brain's chemical dependency to next to nil and my tolerance back down to healthier levels.

Always in moderation, and remember, never do any physically demanding activities when you've taken caffeine, it reduces lung capacity and robs your muscles of nutrients causing them to fatigue very fast under strain. You can create heart problems if you are under it's effects and subject your heart to too much strain, your base heart rate is already elevated and the extra strain can be painful to endure.",24

Leaves are complex factories that produce hundreds of compounds... one of which is Theanine. This compound counters the bad effects of Caffeine (more or less depending on leaf content). As a result Tea should be considered different from other drinks. Also if consumed as a whole leaf either steeped multiple times (Chinese method known as Gongfu) Tea  provides huge doses of antioxidents with decreasing levels of Caffeine allowing Tea to “Wake you in the morning, keep you throughout the day, and put you to sleep soundly at night.” This due to decreasing Caffeine, and the “soporific” (sleep inducing) effect of  Theanine.",2

I was told by my gasterointerologist that it is a great laxative. Just a word to the weary about that, I'm not sure how accurate the side effects page on this is listing diarrhea as a ""rare"" side effect, but I suppose the days where insomnia is your only company and the next day of work mocks you for it, on those days it's worth putting up with the less than pleasant side effects for the ability to stay up and get the job done. Just remember to back off the stuff when your hands start shaking, figure out how long it takes to get through your system and space out the caffeine in those intervals to avoid overdose. for me it's about 2-3 hours. Body weight plays a factor, I happen to be a lean man in his mid 20's, so you may have separate circumstances. It is easy to build up a tolerance similar to alcohol requiring substantially more to get the same effect. This also creates a chemical dependency that can cause migraines when your brain is deprived of it. I avoid this by putting up with the migraines for a few days and avoid caffeinated food and supplements for up to 3 months. After that time I generally have brought my brain's chemical dependency to next to nil and my tolerance back down to healthier levels.

Always in moderation, and remember, never do any physically demanding activities when you've taken caffeine, it reduces lung capacity and robs your muscles of nutrients causing them to fatigue very fast under strain. You can create heart problems if you are under it's effects and subject your heart to too much strain, your base heart rate is already elevated and the extra strain can be painful to endure.",24

However, a year ago I began experiencing issues with peripheral vascular disease associated with varicose veins (ulcerations and subcutaneous bleeding on my calves, joint pain and stiffness, planar fasciitis and chronic leg cramps). 

Within weeks of treating my varicose veins with compression stockings and elevation, I noted increased postural tachycardia, which became debilitating after 3 months (could no longer work). While waiting to see my PCP, I came off the melatonin and both my tachycardia and varicose veins began improving significantly. Three weeks after discontinuing its use, the tachycardia disappeared and the varicose veins improved enough to allow me to go without compressions stockings for intervals of several hours.

Have found nothing to explain the correlation but for a study in European Journal of Phramocology, vol 345, 1 March 1998 (NIH medical journal database), where the authors discuss the presence of MT1 & MT2 receptors (to which melatonin binds) in smooth muscle of vascular tissue and their role in vasodilation and constriction, respectively, as an explanation for melatonin’s systemic efficacy.

While my overall condition improved when I discontinued use, I did experience a brief period of cognitive impairment and an uptick in mean blood pressure, the latter of which may require me to seek treatment should it persist. Finally have a follow-up with a cardiologist.

But the problem is, each brand and dose of melatonin (and possibly each ""batch"") is SO different. A few brands have worked consistently better than prescription sleep aids for me, but unfortunately MOST brands are either ineffective, or produce the opposite effect desired (eg, I needed a Xanax to counteract the nervous, gittery feelings, then I still couldn't sleep but at least I wasn't jittery.)

One 3mg brand I like is pretty consistent for me (and $3/month! cheap!), but the same brand has a few other doses, plus a ""dissolvable"" 3mg dose with sweetening added, and of course all the bottles look the same, so I've accidentally bought the wrong ones (or if the right ones were sold out, tried another dose): ALL the other doses of the ""good brand"" didn't work. And the sugary one gave me the ""nervousness"" effect.

After a few YEARS of trying melatonin for sleep (on and off), though I have a decent one now, I really think the FDA should be looking at what these vitamin companies put into these pills. At least there should be consistency from ""batch to batch"" (same brand/dose).

So when you hit luck with a good one, it's very effective. But it really feels like a crapshoot when you open the next bottle. I'd love to put my brand/dose as 5-star satisfaction, but since this review is just ""melatonin"", I've got to consider the rest of my experiences with melatonin. Mostly positive, but even the few times I've gotten ""the jitters"" ...why package and sell a sleep aid that makes insomnia a nightmare?

I like that it is not addictive. I particularly like it when my schedule is irregular and I need to get to bed earlier than normal for an early am appointment. It gets you sleepy in about 20 mins. (of course it's best to start settling down for the evening). It is a dream enhancer though, the higher the dose as in 5-10mg the more one will tend to dream. This can make one feel as though they haven't slept. Best to start with a small dose and increase until you find a dosage that makes you sleepy in the 20 min range. Then go to bed. If you don't your body will just work it through and it will do no good. I also like to combine this with Valerian root which produces a sound sleep. Also non addictive. One of each on any given work night is about the right dose for me.  The melatonin dose is 1mg and the valerian is 500 mg.  I have taken up to 10 mg of melatonin with no ill effects, however you will need 8-11 hours of sleep with that dosage and you may still wake up groggy. I have also taken up to 2000 mg of valerian root with no ill effects and no grogginess (in case you have never taken valerian root it smells like dirty socks, really dirty socks lol).  Both products are relatively inexpensive. My size is 5'4"" and I weight around 145-150. Judge your dosage according to your size. I have used nearly all makes and models of both products",13
204,3,7/30/2015 1:47:47 PM,Insomnia,"CircleInTheSquare, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Consumer)",5,5,5,"I have been taking melatonin for about 12 years for sleep problems - started at about 300 mcg ~1/2 hour before bedtime, increasing, when effectiveness lagged, gradually to 3 mg (i use the Natrol 3 mg tablet, which was not listed, so I used the Natrol 5 mg for this comment). Added 50 mg Bendryl (diphenhydramine)per night a few years ago and have not needed to change either dose since. I sleep through the night and wake up refreshed but sometimes a bit groggy. A good cardio workout takes care of that. Very important - try cutting down, or better, eliminating caffeine. 
I've tried a number of brands of melatonin, but many don't work. I've settled on Natrol, because it works. There are probably others that work also, but I haven't seen any reason to experiment unless/until the Natrol becomes unavailable or stops working. Remember that these are not manufactured as drugs and there is no required test for what's in the tablet. If the first brand doesn't work for  you, try others until you find one. That doesn't mean you will necessarily succeed - melatonin doesn't work for everybody. Try it, though. Start with low doses and adjust as you see how it affects you. Good luck!",54

Rather than put me to sleep it woke me up and gave me moe energy in the first few hours after taking it each night my dreams or rather My nightmares were much much more vivid  and memorable, before this i cannot remember having or at least remembering any dreams in the last 6 months. When I did sleep, every third day or so, my sleep was much shorter topping out between 3 and  hours. Then for the 2 days after I stopped taking it I slept about 21 hours a day and was extremely groggy when I was awake (afterwards, that is after the 2 day snooze fest, I returned to my normal insomnia problems.)But the worst side effect, reportedto me by family and coworker, was that while I kept taking the melatonin I was extremely irritable, easily annoyed and angered, not to mention so energized and thinking and talking a mile a minute most of the time when I had to be really alert for work, I guess to compensate my groginess (a sort of adrenaline rush of some kind and I imagine it was like some people feel when on speed or something, or immediately after coming off of it. It got so bad at one point that I was suspended for three days from my management job because I scared an employee and maybe even a few. Which is the exact opposite of what people usually tell me, i.e. I am usually so patient, happy, understanding, forgiving and helpfull.    Anyway, that was my experience of it.

276,3,4/28/2014 9:01:30 PM,Benzodiazepine withdrawal,"John shepherd, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months",3,5,3,"Benzodiazepines cause tolerance and physical dependence within two to four weeks, and, upon cessation acute withdrawal traditionally requires tapered management. Additionally in some long term users experience withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal syndrome can last many months and is typified by a major depressive episode, agitation, and lack of ability to get to sleep. This is a serious side effect which needs careful monitoring.
ol
For this reason Benzodiazepines need to be used with extreme caution and for very short periods.

Melatonin is effective for sleep disturbances that are not caused by an over active nervous system, such is in the case of Benzodiazepine withdrawal. It appears virtually ineffective during acute (tapered) withdrawal, although somewhat helpful during withdrawal syndrome. For this reason it's main purpose during withdrawal is an adjunct with other therapies.

To my knowledge Melatonin does not effect the calcium channels that have been disturbed by benzodiazepine usage and this is why, in my view, Melatonin is not very effective on it's own as an Anxiolytic (antianxiety agent.)

My experience is that SSRI's are not very effective for use for withdrawal, however responses to SSRI's are individual dependant.

It is essential to manage benzodiazepine withdrawal and protracted withdrawal syndrome using a variety of methods including CBT, but most effectively, using an alternative Anxiolytic, the most effective of which is Phenibut (CALMEXA).

Phenibut Calmexa is GABA with a phenyl ring that allows it to pass the blood brain barrier, therefore replacing the GABA depleted by benzodiazepine dependence. With medical management it can safely and entirely replace the use of Benzodiazepines, causing an alternative dependence both easier to taper with less risk of protracted withdrawal syndrome. 

Melatonin used together with Phenibut is very effective for inducing sleep, establishing and maintaining a sleeping pattern.

My pain tolerance is so high that even the class 2 meds i take give short term relief. One doc in the er came back after giving pain shot and was shocked I was still awake saying I gave you enough to knock out a horse. He had not seen that high tolerance before.
I was unable to use my cpap correctly because I was tossing and turning in pain or discomfort in finding a comfortable sleep position and waking up because of the apnea.   I have had  chronic insomnia for over 20 years tried everything including prescription meds. Tried melatonin appropriate 2 months ago. Been able to get at least 4 to 5 straight hours of sleep. Wake up not drowsy and feeling more rested than I have in years. From a chronic pain and insomnia suffered this gives me hope. I use to be so tired during the day from restless night. I know there was strain on my heart and body due to constant lack of sleep. Now I can use the cpap with the goal of reaching 6 to 8 hours. I started with 3 pills down to 2 looking toward being able to just take one.
Different people have different response I am just thankful for sleep. You don't miss something till you don't have it.

My overall advice is to only use as needed to give your body a chance to produce it on it's own. My personal recommendation is to take 3 to 5 and no more than 6 mgs. about 30 to 60 minutes before you want to fall asleep. More than that is not recommended by any source.

Trouble falling and staying asleep. Erratic work schedule. I use melatonin infrequently but with extremely high doses (ie used 20mg last night). Result: vivid dreams, but it helps to keep me asleep. Normally I'll sleep for 4 hours, then wake, sometimes can't fall asleep again. Chronic fatigue. I'm reviewing just to let people know that this dosage is safe for me (I feel well rested, still tired but not wired, not irritable). The dreams are to be looked out for, like I said extremely vivid especially the first couple times using melatonin.
The diagnose of fibro should convey to readers that I have experienced chronic physiological (specifically muscular and nervous system) arousal for prolonged periods of time (10-15 years) due to environmental and emotional stress & poor cultural/familial support for stress resolution. Worst instance of emotional stress from 9-22 years old. It has not been fun.

I take 3mg of melatonin approximately mid-day to advance my sleep phase.  The timing needs to be precise in relationship to my internal body clock, which is not always easy to know.  If I wake after an hour of heavy dream sleep, my waking time is a reliable marker and I will take melatonin eight hours later.  If I hit the right timing window, I'll have fairly strong fatigue within an hour.  This lasts for a couple of hours.  I can't do certain kinds of work in this state, but I can do housework and listen to lectures.  I call it my stupid pill, but it doesn't actually make me stupid, but impairs my ability to generate outward focus.  Missing my window even once can make it hard to recover the required timing accuracy.  The difference is profound.  I can tell I miss the window because I have far less fatigue.  Taking coffee at the same time as the melatonin significantly reduces fatigue, but it also made the treatment less reliable.  Used to have an ""all nighter"" without fail at least once every three weeks for twenty years.  In my first year on melatonin, I lost control only three times and had to flip over.  Variability in the potency messed me up on one of those.  One vendor didn't work at all.  Another vendor works well most of the time, but some bottles aren't all there.  Think I get mild stomach irritation at night, nothing really to complain about, and it could be other things in the pill.  My life is spectacularly better since I discover this, having found the research myself.  Would love to find a 100% consistent formulation.

Today is the 4th day of taking 5-HTP. I still feel sad, have negative thoughts and bouts of anger, but they quickly dissipate and no longer linger on to consume me like what they used to. There’s this sense of calmness that is allowing me to make sound judgements and decisions without being hampered by negative feelings all the time. I feel like the decisions that I make will lead to positive results, as opposed to bad endings that I used to feel prior to taking 5–HTP.
Might be too early, but I can safely say that I am no longer a victim of my own depressive thoughts.  I am no longer a person who is constantly sad and angry. The only flip side is that 5-HTP does wreak some havoc in my stomach and I feel bloated with gas at times. But it does seem to feel less intense as the days go and I am hoping that my gut will get used to this supplement. 
Overall, what a miracle supplement. My only regret is that why didn't anyone informed me about 5-HTP earlier. I feel as if so many decades of my life wasted on being weary all the time and so many days and opportunities to seek happiness were missed. Nonetheless, better late than never.

I experienced results within three days of taking 50mg once a day in the AM. It works for me, YMMV. The mood effect is subtle but consistent. My mood feels more stable, particularly more resilient. I have fewer anxiety spikes.

I didn't take it for sleep disturbance, but it has improved the quality of sleep significantly. I wake up much earlier and without grogginess when I've taken it the day before. I also have dreams that I remember. Part of the stress resilience I feel may come from the effects the 5-HTP has had on my sleep.

It's probably not a plug-and-play supplement that can safely be taken on its own. Do your research. I take l-tyrosine with it (to prevent dopamine depletion/imbalance). The recommended ratio is 10:1, but my body seems to do better with 5:1. Because 5-HTP can cause heart valve damage via increased peripheral serotonin, I take EGCG (which effectively neutralizes the peripheral serotonin that doesn't make it past the BBB) and omega-3 (to increase bio-availability of the EGCG).",5

I had already begun a change in my mentality before the 5-HTP that was pulling me out of my depression but the 5-HTP just catapulted me straight upwards and I feel that it is speeding the process. Somedays I just look around me and am in this feeling of wonder and aliveness. It's like that feeling of life has been handed back to me. It's very meditative.

I feel it's my duty to let everybody know that 5-htp actually works. I'll be honest with you and admit that I've been experimenting with MDMA, which on some occasion brought me lows (depression) for a few days after consuming it. Hearing it can help manage those symptoms, I decided to buy it. (It's really a harm reduction strategy and not an encouragment do to MDMA!)

Since buying 5-HTP, I've taken it twice, and NOT after MDMA but while completely sober and feeling fine, and unexpectedly it made me a whole lot more content and healed some low level anxieties. It actually made me feel good and not crave any kind of drug to make me more happy (i.e. alcohol, tobbaco, MDMA). It's not that I'm an addict by any means, but I often have this desire to get f****d up for no good reason really. It also made me sleep a whole lot better, without waking up during the night, and the dreams were crazy vivid and life-like but I liked it, it's interesting. Oh yeah, and there were some ""side effects"": sleepines, perhaps not feeling mentally as sharp, feeling a bit mellowed out. Well, it's not that any of these are bad by themselves, but they can sort of have an effect on your productivity. Taking it before bad is probably the wisest, so you sleep it over. :)

I forgot to mention: The first time I took 200 mg and I think it was a bit too much. I was feeling very balanced and in good mood, but overpowered by side effects. Second time it was 50 mg before sleep.

I'm not saying I'll start to use it regularly, but I can see it's potential for reducing depression and anxiety. It's legal and it really does have an effect which is definietly not placebo. I personally could probably reccomend it even for just having fun or relaxing. Why not take 100 or 200mg and chill out with friends? It does have some slightly euphoric effects. IMO far better and helthier than drinking booze or doing some drugs to achieve that feeling or get rid of anxieties. Just a thought!

Wish you the best :)",8

Effects usually hit 2-4 hours after taking it: general boost in mood, difficult to think negative thoughts, warm fuzzy feeling, sometimes even euphoria. Feelings of love, from loving what you're doing, to feeling better about people around you. Similar feeling to MDMA. I don't know why, it might just be my experience, but the effects seriously last 3 days or so. Then for about 3-4 more days just a general content feeling. After about a week you're back at baseline but I swear that's better than before when I never took any anti-depressants. 

BTW, messing with serotonin is dangerous, why I've never sought to get prescribed SSRIs or anything. That's why I only take 1 100mg pill every few days, it only takes a small amount to change the balance of serotonin in your brain. It takes other chemicals in your brain to work....so too much, and you might not even feel the desired effects, just the bad side effects. 100mg/day to me would be crazy. Side effects include a stiff jaw/temples, headaches, stomachache, vomiting, and can last as long it takes for your body to clear all the serotonin. I also don't take it at night as jaw clenching can be bad at night, sometimes even at my low dosage.",95

I have been struggling with depression and anxiety lately and decided to go back to taking this after losing all motivation for things and needed a ""pick me up"". My previous experience I used the recommended dose of 100 3x a day and it caused me to have more anxiety and lethargic feelings which I cannot surely say it was from the 5-HTP. However, this time taking it I have found a sweet spot in dosing and it has kick started a incredibly productive time full of optimism and positivity. I am pretty impressed to say the least. That one little pill a day has caused me to completely turn my mood around into something so positive so that I could go about my day with productivity again. I can also note that my sleep schedule and problems with insomnia have completely dissolved allowing me to have peaceful yet deep slumber every single night. I go to sleep and wake up in the same spot! I wake up feeling ready to start the day instead of wishing I had a few more hours to sleep. A side effect to take into consideration before trying out 5HTP is increased dreaming. It caused my first full blown lucid dream and has made my dreams more lucid and intense. To me it was a good side effect but it may be bothersome for others. Overall, I will continue to take one a day and see how far this goes. ",118

It kind of 'paralyses' your mind and thats probably why it works great as an anti-depressant.

I have been on and off antidepressants for years, but nothing has ever 'worked'. I would give up on them after a few months, until things got absolutely unbearable again & would finally drag myself off to the doctors to try another one. Even St Johns Wort had awful effects, and I essentially got to the point of accepting my perpetual unhappiness, and considering suicide as inevitable & the only option for future relief. 
Until.... 5-htp. 
I am extremely aware that everyone reacts differently to different chemicals, but for me, it has been a godsend. I take 2 x 100 casuals at night, and from day 3 onward, I have literally never felt better.
 I sleep, have lovely calm dreams (as apposed to constant nightmares), wake up energised & I am happy & completely at peace. 
I have suddenly & completely gone off sugar, and although I am not overweight, I have lost 3 kilos in 2 weeks. 
This would actually be my only warning; if you are someone who struggles to gain & retain weight, I would be careful on 5-htp & force yourself to eat, even if you don't want to. 
Other than that, I have had a 100% positive experience with no side effects whatsoever, & I would encourage anyone who has depression to give this supplement a chance.

647,4,3/17/2015 1:26:45 PM,Depression,"5htplover, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Consumer)",5,5,5,"I have been on 5-HTP for nearly 8 years, and much happier for it. I started it after my boyfriend died unexpectedly and I fell into a severe depression (normally I suffer from mild depression). I didn’t have insurance, and started researching alternatives to SSRIs. I had taken Zoloft for a spell years ago and it worked for me okay (though I didn’t like the side effects). The day I started taking it it worked! I was able to get out of bed and do the dishes, a major accomplishment at that time in my life. Over time and with an increased dosage, my depression and anxiety lifted and my concentration and focus improved. It also helped my sleep, and I didn’t experience a decreased libido like I did on Zoloft.

My advice:

1) Work with your doctor if you want to try this. Do not take 5-HTP with other meds unless instructed by your doctor as this can cause bad interactions (e.g., see #3 -serotonin syndrome).

2) Start with a low dose and work your way up. I started with 50 mg. Over time I upped it by 50 mg increments until I found what worked for me (150 mg once a day). 

3) Serotonin Syndrome (where getting too much serotonin is toxic) is real, but from what I have read you have to take 300 mg or more before you see toxic effects. This information may change over time as research teases this out, and I suspect it differs depending on the person. 

4) Take an enterically-coated version of 5-HTP. This means it breaks down in the intestine and not the stomach. After a year or so of taking uncoated pills, I started to experience stomach rumbling and discomfort, and a low-grade fever. The enteric pills eliminated this issue. 

5) Get a good quality product to ensure you are getting a pure product. I take Solaray. 

6) If it makes you sleepy, take it at night. I initially tried it on a Saturday day, when I knew I’d have the day off and could see how it made me feel. It made me drowsy. I now take it ~45 minutes before bed and that’s worked well for me.",171

I kept taking the 5-HTP in hopes that this was just a fluke and was not related to taking it, although 5-HTP was the only thing I was taking prescription and non prescription.The twitching just became worse and my muscles became very sore primarily in my arms.This twitching would move from one area of my face to another. I had no idea when it would happen and it was scary. I stopped taking the 5-HTP and all of these symptoms stopped. I really wanted to be able to take this because I felt so much better and I believe my family noticed the improvement in mood. My dose was 50 mg per day.

A side BENEFIT of green tea is that it has theanine which will increase other brain chemicals that might be low.  I suffer from moderate to severe depression at times, and can only 50 mg for about 3-4 days before I start suffering from anxiety.  Then I'm good for weeks.  Take your 5-htp...not too much...for whatever amt of days. As soon as you start getting s/e's, this is your threshold. Do not take again till the benefits wear off.  You'll have to play around with this.  I suspect some people may be more sensitive due to various reasons. Maybe even methylation problems.  Also remember serotonin ain't the only kid on the block.

I am noticeably brighter, less negative, more motivated, able to move about quicker and exercise, and my over-appetite and over-sleeping have gone.  I have never found a non-prescription supplement that had such a real effect - none of the others have helped.  However, I am still adjusting to it, since I feel a bit ""wired"" after taking it.  In addition, I have felt a bit of a seratonin ""high"", which is great but I have to adjust to my new emotions as that extra self-confidence could spill over into irritability or feeling more confident expressing inner emotions.  It is not as severe as hypomania, but there is definitely a lift in mood that is a shock to the system.  However, I will give it time because I would rather be like this than feeling dull, flabby and sleepy, any day!  I initially tried just 50mg per day, which is the amount per tablet in the supplement I am taking, but I didn't notice any difference.

WATCH YOUR DOSAGE!!!   I cut a 100 mg tab into quarters and take only 1 daily, with very rare taking 2, so that is only 25mg daily normally.    Great treatment, but the dosage may be what causes so many of the problems people describe.   Who ever said that 100mg was a 'correct' dosage so that so many people take it as a minimum??!!??    And taking multiple dosages, or multiple times daily....talk about too much of a good thing!!!   Get a pill cutter, or split your capsules.  

I can feel the impact of the treatment within 10-20 min, calming my anxiety.    I usually take around noon.   Have GAD and have had panic attacks.    Xanax was horrible.  Dropped it quickly....thank God.   Since starting this 5htp treatment, and taking some GABA only at bedtime which I added to the mix about a year ago, no panic attacks at all.  Anxiety, but no panic.    

I do take 10-15mg amitryp at bedtime, which is a VERY SMALL dose, not therapuetic accoridng to Doc, but am very careful still with 5htp and the ami.    Never taken together at same time or too close together.

However, no definitive cases of toxicity have emerged despite the worldwide usage for the last 20 years.

  about 9 yrs ago, and after the 1st 30 days felt a noticeable
positive difference in my mental well being. Ive always preferred meds w/ as little man made components as possible when given a choice.  There were no side effects for the 4-5 yrs I took it , @ least that I noticed.  Back then, I could only find 5 HTP sold at specialty stores like GNC or online & was $25-30 back then depending on the brand. I regret stopping taking it, as coincidentally i have recently found out I inherited traits for lack of dopamine production ( yes i realize this works on serotonin), similar to Parkinsons , but may be fibromyalgia.  I resumed taking this yesterday , to promote better happiy feeling thru this stressful time. Luckily I found a bottle at wal-mart for less than $10.   thats new : ). It is 100 mg x 100, i read some of you have headaces etc from it. try reducing to 50 mg which was standafd back then if i remember right. so u would want to find non gel tabs if possible or mix half in a drink?  i will report after 30-60 days updafes considering the highr dosage & unverified source where wal mart bought wholesale from

When I tried I found myself in some sort of mental zombiland that was somewhere betweeen sleep and consciousness.  When I did drift into a shallow sleep I had horrible nightmares.  My muscles were restless and I kept alternating between hot and cold spells.  The next morning I felt like I hadn't slept in days.  I went to work and couldn't focus and had to go home sick.  20 hours later my head feels swimmy and feel like I've been poisoned.  I will never take this again.  Dosage was one 100mg 12-hour time release Natrol tablet.  I got the pills at Costco (didn't see it in the drop down box so I selected what was closest).  The same day I took the pill I also took a Prisolec and ibuprofen.  I don't know if it was a drug interaction or what but this stuff should be dispensed by a pharmacy.,7

Normally, I felt hazy and sluggish which started to be a real problem as I began school at a prestigious college. After the first day of taking 5htp I felt more focused and alert. It acted like a stimulant for me and I even had trouble sleeping the first few weeks. However, others have told me it had the opposite effect on them so I hypothesize that it depends on your already existing serotonin levels. 
I did experience headaches at first but they have now gone away. This did concern me an I would like to know more about the cause.
I also ate less at first, but I now seem to be normalized. It wasn't like being on Ritalin or Adderall where you feel shaky and  the idea of food is repulsive. It's very subtle and you only eat when hungry without overdoing it. 
Overall, 5htp has been a great medication for me. I feel less anxious and with it, I was able to make speeches in public without the crippling fear I had before. ",38

There was a scare about 5HTP in 1988 due to a contaminated batch from Japan, coming from the labs of Showa Denko caused 37 deaths and 1500 permanent disablements. 
Controversy at the time between big pharmas, the biotech and FDA resulted in a blanket ban of 5HTP. Pharmas would rather sell you the more expensive SSRI's. Biotech don't want you to know it was Genetic Engineering caused the problem. FDA played safe and banned everything just in case, or maybe under direction from lobbying by big P & BT.
User consensus says 5-HTP is very helpful, and videos on youtube from qualified professionals saying so. 
Me? I found it immensely helpful and get mine from a reputable source. 
If I hear that ""voice of depression"" I take 2 x 50mg tablets of 5 hydroxy tryptophan in the evening, it gives me a great night's sleep, possibly because it also converts to melatonin and significantly elevates my mood in the morning, presumably due to increased serotonin levels. 
I wish WebMD would update their statement to ""avoid"" this very helpful food supplement, and stop misleading people who need help, but they have not responded to my attempts to contact them with links about the original 5HTP contamination. 
Don't cross medicate with SSRI's or MAOI's and it is probably perfectly safe. 
Look up Tryptophan poisoning on google for yourself.

I had been reading about 5-HTP and seeing the results from comments such as below have been having on peoples lives so decided to try for myself.. what did I have to lose right.. ? My MD had scribed Xanax for me... but it was really causing me to detach from life altogether.. 

I was at Costo last week and found Natrol 5-HTP - although dubious yet excited.. I tried the product and have been taking it for a week.. 

Well I honestly have to say.. WOW.. what a difference... No more Mr Snapper Head and now I am feeling like ""normal"".. I have no idea how it performs on appetite control as I am a foodie.. but I can say without a doubt that my mood has lifted and I am out of my funk and thats after 1 week.. I have found that the stupid small stuff in life that would occupy my mind for no reason at all has pretty much gone.. I have started to accept things for what they are and move on.. instead of dwelling and festering on things.. 
So - my opinion - for what it is worth.. go to Costco or the drug store - try it for yourself.. I think you will see a difference.. as so many people like myself have.

I didn't even know there was a problem until I had a severe panic attack and ended up in the emergency room. I was put on antidepressents (Lexapro originally and Zoloft after) both of which gave me severe panic attacks and anxiety 24 hours a day. I went from functioning to nonfunctioning almost immediately. I began not being able to sleep and having severe migraine headaches. 

I have begun taking 50 mg of 5-htp every other night along with a multi vitamin and fish oil daily.

The Celexa and Prozac both worked well for about 6 months, and then tapered off.  Increasing the dose had the same effect after a few months.  I weaned myself off the Prozac (with my doctor's approval) during the spring and summer months, and found that with the use of 5 HTP I didn't need to go back on it in the fall for seasonal affective disorder.  At one point I was out of my 5 HTP supplement for about a month, and EVERYONE noticed how much my moods were affected!!!  I felt exhausted, miserable, angry and sad, like having permanent PMS!!!  Within a week of returing to my regular 5 HTP doe, I felt so much better and more in control of my emotions.  I felt normal!!!  This supplement has really been a God-send for me and my loved ones.  It feels great to not be on any antidepressant meds, and to feel good about myself not requiring the medication anymore.  I strongly urge anyone who has depression issues to look into 5 HTP therapy.  It can be used in conjunction with some traditional medications, but you need to check with your doctor.  Please do your research prior to taking any supplement.  I have nothing but good things to say about 5 HTP.  It was definitely the best thing I have ever done for myself (and my husband appreciates it, too!!!).",102

I was told by my gasterointerologist that it is a great laxative. Just a word to the weary about that, I'm not sure how accurate the side effects page on this is listing diarrhea as a ""rare"" side effect, but I suppose the days where insomnia is your only company and the next day of work mocks you for it, on those days it's worth putting up with the less than pleasant side effects for the ability to stay up and get the job done. Just remember to back off the stuff when your hands start shaking, figure out how long it takes to get through your system and space out the caffeine in those intervals to avoid overdose. for me it's about 2-3 hours. Body weight plays a factor, I happen to be a lean man in his mid 20's, so you may have separate circumstances. It is easy to build up a tolerance similar to alcohol requiring substantially more to get the same effect. This also creates a chemical dependency that can cause migraines when your brain is deprived of it. I avoid this by putting up with the migraines for a few days and avoid caffeinated food and supplements for up to 3 months.

Always in moderation, and remember, never do any physically demanding activities when you've taken caffeine, it reduces lung capacity and robs your muscles of nutrients causing them to fatigue very fast under strain.

I did some research and self diagnosed with IBS- Literally constant diarrhea and it was always connected directly to time limits. If I needed to be somewhere at a certain time- as soon as the time was approaching- I would have diarrhea. Every day all day. I tried a walgreens and started looking up natural remedies and the first thing I Found was a green box IBS GARD With green capsuls containing pepermint oil beads. I was reluctant and sceptical but I was so tired of the literal shhh* that I would try anything. The packaging states to allow 24 hrs to kick in and also states to take 1-2 daily. I took one and noticed right away the calming effects. You might burp a little peppermint type burp, This is considered normal per the packaging instructions. I have take maybe three- five capsuls in this three week period since I bought the package and it makes the diarrhea go away for a day or two. Initially you might want to proceed with caution as you do not want to end up constipated for two days so start small. start with one.

My acid reflux meds were destroying my immune system and digestion system that have caused all sort of health issues over the past 7.5 years. These meds are far more dangerous than the average person or doctors understand. By slowing down or almost stopping your digestion system it allows certain food proteins and oral meds to pass through your stomach straight into your intestinal tract which can cause sensitivity to these proteins and meds, which can cause allergies and over sensitivity to meds therefore rendering the meds ineffective. If on those meds for a extended period of time and you take antibiotics, or have procedures like colonoscopies where you clean out your intestinal tract with their man-made laxatives, which destroys all the good and bad bacteria in your digestive system, which also weakens the immune system. It is a deadly merry go round that will destroy your health or eventually kill you. All I know is that Aloe Versa Juice has put an end to some of the merry go round I was on. I now am trying to find out just how much of my body those meds destroyed and if I can reverse any of the damage to my body.
  All I know is now I have a better chance to live and hopefully have a chance at life again, all thanks to Aloe Versa Juice. People, beware of your doctors and their meds. All you have to do is Google the side effects of your meds and you will be amazed just how dangerous they really are. Be care full of anything you take other than natural foods, and even those can be dangerous to some!",142

My wife continued taking aloe gel caps, in September of 2012 she had a blocked artery in the exact same spot as mine in the R Coronary Artery at 59. She stopped taking it too now. She didn't have a heart attack, did have chest pains bad enough to go to the hospital 3 times. The 1st 2 times they missed the blockage with CT Scan, ECG, Stress Test, blood work. The 3rd time they did a heart cath and found this 99% blockage. The Cardio said she was in the 11th hour, ready to have a massive heart attack. She came home 3 days later with a stent in the exact same spot as mine.

Was it the Aloe? My wife took it for 4 years or more and grabbed her chest. I took it 3 years or more and grabbed my chest. Could be a coincidence, but somehow I will always wonder. The Cardio has told us to never take it again.

If you were my Wife, Dad, Mom, Brother or Sister, I would tell you not to risk it. It did a wonderful job of clearing up my Psoriasis and even dandruff, still gotta wonder if it almost killed us both. Use it topically. 

I wonder why there aren't long term studies of these herbs.  ",5

I am a mid 50 year old male. I have peripheral nueropathy. I was a professional musician most of my life and my neurolgist says my pn is likely a by product of too much sex, drugs and rock n roll ;-) Seriously though, she thinks 6 (alcohol) drinks a night for 30 years with a few other things here and there is the contributing factor (I quit everything 3 years ago). 

Anyway, my feet would hurt so bad, especially at night I couldn't sleep. I was wearing special shoes. Walking was painful. I used all the lidocaine and capsaicin creams and sprays. I tried a TENS unit. My Dr put me on Gabapentin (yuck). Someone in the waiting room at the Dr. office suggested ALA.

NO BS.... I noticed a difference after the first week. 1600 mg/day. Within a month probably @ 50? improvement (I quit taking Gabapentin at this point). 3 months saw @ 90% improvement (dosage here was reduced to 1200 mg/day). 6 months @ 95? better (dosage reduced to 800mg/day).

After just over a year at a dose of 800mg/day my pn is (depending on the day) between 98%-100% gone!!!! It is summer of 2016 and I have spent a significant amount of time walking around barefoot outdoors. I can wear any shoe I want, even my footwear of choice, cowboy boots. I even got my first ever pedicure a couple weeks ago. 

You have nothing to lose, so try it, I sure hopes it does for you what it did for me.

Who asked how can you tell if ALA is working.
1) Monitor your blood sugar for a week WITHOUT the ALA.
2) Take ALA as suggested for a week and monitor your blood sugar.
See if your blood sugar has gone down or if any of your symptoms are better (though it's too early to really tell but some people actually get early results)
3) Keep taking ALA til the bottle runs out.
Check your blood sugar levels til ALA runs out. 
If A) Your blood sugar levels go down, then the ALA is working.
B) If your blood sugar doesn't go down BUT you see improvement in any of your symptoms,
continue with the ALA. Check to see how long it's safe to take ALA. Keep taking ALA for as long (length of time) as said to be safe.
Hope this helps those who want to know.

Eventually, if I keep taking it, it has a lot less of that effect. I take breaks from it for a few weeks after using it nightly for a few months to a year, because of a concern that it competes with the B-vitamin biotin, which has strong value for one's health. I take biotin every day earlier in the day away from the lipoic. I have tried using lipoic in conjunction with heavy metal detox protocols (modified citrus pectin and/or chlorella and/or cilantro in my green veggie juices, etc.) because the research behind that is, as I understand it, quite sound and convincing if done the right way. Should not be used too early in the program if one is definitely laden with mercury, because it can mobilize Hg in a way that it may bring more INTO the brain instead of removing it. For that purpose, should be used after a lot of whole body Hg detox has taken place first over a long period of time, and THEN use it every 3 hours I believe (might have been 2.5) to help remove some mercury.

I've been taking R-Alpha Lipoic Acid, from Jarrows, for quite some time for type 2 diabetes and diabetic neuropathy.  Recently a mix-up occurred and I wasn't putting it with my daily pills.  I also use a fentanyl duragesic patch and a strong hydromorphone dose for breakthrough pain for this and other issues.  

I have a LOT of prescriptions to manage, so missing one pill is easy.  I had to take more and more hydromorphone to get any relief from my neuropathy, which was unusual, but a few hours later I'd be hurting again.  After a couple weeks I was literally starting to get desperate so we went through my pills and found the missing bottle of Alpha Lipoic Acid.  I took a couple that morning, and I was back to normal by the afternoon!

Now don't get it in your head that if you take it just when you have a neuropathy flare-up that you will get instant improvement -- maybe it helped me so fast since I took it for so long, but who knows.  I can't recommend it enough though -- strong painkillers barely helps neuropathy, but this stuff works fantastic.

I have no idea if it's true or not, but you should try and get the ""active"" version of Alpha Lipoic so that your body can use it immediately.  I use a 100 mg dose of the Jarrow R-ALA morning and evening for neuropathy, which runs me about $17 a month when I buy them from Amazon.

Seriously, try it.  Take it for a month and see if you notice your nerve pain go away.  If not, then stop taking it ... and see if you notice it then.  I sure as heck did...

Note that I can't find Jarrow Formula's on the product brand, but hopefully the one I chose is close enough.  Search Amazon for Jarrow Formulas R-Alpha Lipoic Acid and that should do it too.",5

In my case, I believe even 300mg was too much to begin with as I have a nasty skin reaction in already compromised sweat glands with plenty of redness, angry patches & itching. I needed cephalexin antibiotic to clear it up along with exposure to sunshine, lavender and herb poultice applied (with chickweed, red clover and yellow dock). I believe this may be due to too rapid detox as kidneys cannot handle the load & skin must ooze out heavy metals which smell bad(mercury from tooth fillings)etc. Still, dealing with cellulitus which I have been hospitalized for repeatedly, is much worse than this rash. I take low doses of antibiotic because I have severe skin reactions to them too. If you are very toxic, be careful & go slow",16

I just started walking and working out 2 days a week and feel 15 years younger doing it. Buy a jug or a quart of organic unfiltered apple cider vinegar with the mother for around $4.25 and some bone broth and watch the fat melt away. Give it a month along with avoiding the poison foods like processed food. deli big no no did I mention no refined sugar as well pepsi and sweet tea is the top 2 worst. P.S you should probably dilute it with a little water so you don't screw up your enamel on your teeth or mess with your esophagus.Im not doing this but I do chase it with a glass of water. I use lipton or braggs or great value just so its organic unfiltered with mother give it 6 weeks and you will lose about 8-11 lbs.a month with hardly trying.

the numbers creeping up really hit me hard and even though i have been low carb and gluten free for years i haven't lost any weight either. so i read about acv and thought i would give it a try. 

i used the crap grocery store stuff and could barely keep it down but had 2 tbsp before bed and my bs was immediately down the next day to 9s. the next day 8s and that way ever since in the 6 weeks i have been taking the acv.

i read about braggs raw and unpasteurized acv got some and it is far more drinkable. i now take 2 tbsp in half a cup of tomato juice at bed and a teaspoon before meals which i am going to up to 1 tbsp.

so now my numbers have gone down 30% and the toppers is that i am down 2 belt holes too! wearing jeans i haven't worn in 5 years.

i cannot recommend the acv more highly but i do have another matter which has help and that is a food diary.

myfitnesspal dot com lets you input all that you eat and automatically tells you how many cars, calories, fiber etc.

i had now idea onions were so high in carbs. i had no idea mussels had carbs. this program really helped me fine tune my carb intake.

Instantly the burning ,nausea, stomach fullness feels lessened, as thought it is helping increase stomach acid aiding the digestion process. The burning that my Mom felt when she laid down was diagnosed as acid reflux or GURD she was prescribed acid reducers that took weeks to work, and she had to use constantly. That is when I first  tryed apple cider vinegar in water.
 I read that increasing the acid, NOT reducing the acid, will help digest food that is sitting in the stomach undigested, it made sense to me, I tried it and it has always worked for me, any time I feel full, burp or nausea, I try the vinegar in water. It only happens to me if I overeat late at night or when I have to take a lot of oral medication all at one time, that is hard to digest (hard caplets).
I have been using grocery store liquid, any brand, I did not know about any of the below listed kinds! I did
 like the natural  trader joe brand or any health food  store kind, that is cloudy. Cheap store brands are very acidic and hard to swallow,  but that is what I'm looking for, to increase the acid level in my gut. If you think about it it really makes sense. If food is backing up into the esophagus, it needs to digest faster.

I had taken 2 on December 6th, and got terribly sick.  Intense vomiting, weakness and body aches.  At that time I chocked it up to a stomach flue bug.  In the back of my mind I kind of thought that the Ashwagandha had something to do with it that day, so I hadn't taken anymore.  This past Monday was my day off so I thought I would give it another try, this time I took 1 table.  In two hours I was vomiting intensely again, basically in the same manner I did on December 6th.  I couldn't function for the next 4 hours.  I continued to vomit and feel very poor the rest of the day.  And today, two days later, i'm still not feeling 100 percent.   
So, I did some checking and according to the information I found, it can effect those who take Thyroid medications.  When I was a kid I had graves disease and had my Thyroid completely removed and I take the medication Synthyroid for that condition.   I'm guessing that that has something to do with the reaction I had???

My mom is able to distinguish between her dreams and reality.  She doesn't wake up screaming about things that she had been dreaming about.  During the day she doesn't hallucinate.  If she does hallucinate about people and wild animals or the room changing, she takes 4 pellets of a homeopathic remedy, Helleborus Niger 30 C.

We also changed her diet.  We've cut out gluten - wheat, rice, barley, rye and Oats.  We also cut out all plants of the deadly night shade variety - tomatoes, eggplant, peppers and potatoes.  

She excercises everday on a treadmill for 20 minutes at a slow speed.  

She plays piano and works on jigsaw puzzles.

It has been a life-changer for me. I no longer worry about whether my hair is arranged properly to cover all the balding areas, I no longer worry about going out in the wind or the rain or the sun -- all of which can reveal thinning hair. And, I look so much younger with a full head of hair. It really seems like a miracle, because now I have completely normally thick hair after having had badly thinning hair for approximately 45 years! Here is the additional information I wanted to share: (1) As I have continued to use biotin, my hair has continued to thicken and it just never seems to shed any more. (2) I use whatever kind of biotin is available, not necessarily a particular brand name. Lately, I have been buying ""Nature's Bounty"" from Sam's Club. (3) I take one (1) 10,000 mcg gelcap-type dose per day. (4) You must tell your doctor you are taking biotin -- make sure the information is entered on your chart, because the use of biotin can affect the results of your blood tests. I had told my doctor I was taking biotin and it was on my chart, but when I went in for my most recent physical and lab tests, the doctor called back and said my thyroid function looked a little off, which he said might have been due to the biotin, and he had me stay off the biotin for four (4) days and then come back in and take the test again (which was fine). So, do tell your doctor you are taking biotin, and lay off the biotin for several days before you go in for lab tests so you don't have to repeat the test the way I did. Anyway, I do urge you to try this stuff -- it truly is a miracle and has made me feel so much more confident about my appearance!",50

I have used Rogaine ever since it came out, but it did not thicken my hair much. I began taking Biotin about 6 months ago. For the first 3 months, I felt my hair was thickening, but only slightly. I figured I needed additional help so I began taking some of the supplements listed in the famous Bargello's Vitamin Regimen (Google it). I have taken a multivitamin for many years along with a Vitamin D supplement, so I added MSM, Evening Primrose, and Flaxseed Oil to my regimen. (No real science to my choice of products; I just went to Natural Grocers and stopped buying after my total reached $40.) I also added Vitamin B-12, based on some online reading. I have not added iron although some sources suggest it might be helpful. I have had no side effects at all, except -- about a month after adding the supplements, I experienced the worst shed of my life. My hair line receded (even more) and my hair thinned all over my scalp. With some careful teasing, artful arranging of the hair, generous application of Toppik, and lots of hairspray to keep everything in place, I was able to camouflage the shed enough to ride things out. It took about a month of misery and self-consciousness, but now my hair is growing in thicker than it has since I was a youngster! My hairline is filling in and there are no thin spots anywhere on my scalp, and the hair that is coming in is not the thin, fragile hair you get after your hair follicles have practically shut down, but robust medium-coarse hair and with no shedding to speak of -- I see only about 5 hairs in the sink after I comb my hair and arrange it, when I used to see at least 20-30.

After taking Wellbutrin for abouta year, I noticed gradual hair loss.  I stopped taking it and felt desperate to regain my thick hair.  I choose to buy Biotin 10,000 to speed up the process; big mistake!!!  Within a few months,  my scalp became itchy.  I sought treatment and help, but no doctor could determined be the cause.  I was told to use dandruff shampoo, which never helped.  A few months later, I began having itchy patches on my body; mainly my elbows, knees, low back, outter thighs and my stomach.  Again, I asked a few doctors for help and was told that I have Ecezma for the first time in my life.  I used the steroid cream without much relief, so began feeling hopeless and depressed.  The itching is so bad that I rarely get a good nights sleep.  

Long story short, I threw out all of my vitamins, thinking it had to be an allergic reaction to one of them.  The only one I kept was the biotin 10,000.  As my itching didn’t subside, I finally realized that it must be the biotin.  I did some on-line research and found that doses over 2,500 can cause skin eruptions, itchy rash and scalp!!!!  I have stopped taking it, and the it hi g is slowly becoming less severe.  I am truly hoping that gmo has only get better, as I have been determined to find the cause if my itching.  I have never had this issue before, and pray that I have found the reason.  So far, so good!!!  I can see that they don’t even list a Biotin 10,000 below, so picked Natures Bounty 5,000, so x2 a day!!!?? ugh!!!    I am just hoping that I can spare someone the anguish that I have endured.

I remember that at the beginning i did heavy cardio and interval training which helped me lose weight fast but i did not realize how biotin played a part in my weight loss until AFTER i stopped working out. I continue to take biotin every day and now that I am no longer on my diet i eat whatever i want and i don't gain weight. It appears the biotin may be keeping my metabolism to the level it was at during my training. So i highly recommend it to you. For me the best is www.certifiedbiotin.com my friends also use this one.

After 3 or 4 months of taking it,I began to notice an odd side effect-my nails were Breaking at a ridiculous rate. I had thought that Biotin was supposed to Strengthen nails?? But mine are as brittle as anything and I have to constantly keep them trimmed right down to nothing or they crack,chip and break at the slightest contact. My hair,btw,did Not stop falling, but my Facial hair did increase. Long hairs in eyebrows and quick growing beard, but no luck on the scalp.It's supposed to be good for Diabetics, of which I am one, so I will likely keep taking it,but as for hair and nails,it's sure not much good for me.Oddly enough,when hospitalized recently for an unrelated problem,Biotin was the Only supplement that the hospital gave me while there.Standing by the bedside,I looked down and the bed was Covered with fallen hair.

It seems I am having greater hair loss (however after almost  a years worth of growth my hair has grown at a normal rate and is longer than when I started which could be why it appears there is more hair loss). The treatment has been easy to take but overall I could say I saw not real change. I have not underlying conditions, I was simply looking to grow my hair out faster and since I have fine hair I wanted to prevent the hair loss I was experiencing. I should note it is not substantial hair loss. From reading other reviews it seems to work for others with more of a chronic balding type of hair loss or those with other underlying (thyroid issues, Biotin deficiency etc...) conditions, since I didn't fall into either of those, perhaps thats why it didn't work for me. I do hope it works for you if you decide to use it. Good luck!",4

It worked!  However I started having pretty severe headaches from it.  At first I thought the headaches were related to something at work (the start of a new school year, as I work for the school district).  However, it finally occurred to me after about 2 ½ months of frequent severe headaches and asking myself if I had been doing anything differently or eating anything different to cause them, that MAYBE it was the Biotin causing it.  

Coincidentally, I had started taking the biotin right about the same time as the start of the school year.  I stopped taking the biotin as soon as it occurred to me that it might be causing the headaches.  My doctor was skeptical that it was the biotin, but thought perhaps it was the ‘delivery system’ (the other ingredients in the pill besides the biotin).  She also suggested it might take a few weeks to get entirely out of my system and she was right.  The headaches did start lessening immediately, though.  After about 4 weeks, I was back to having the occasional sinus headache or tension headache.  

Just to do an experiment and to test my doctor’s hypothesis that it might just be the delivery system, after 6 months off the biotin, I tried it again.  I tried a different brand that my friend swore was the answer to her weak, brittle finger nails – and it had 1,000 mcg of biotin in it.  I decided to take only one (when I had originally been taking 3,000 mcg) and SURE ENOUGH, THE NEXT DAY I HAD A SEVERE HEADACHE!  Again, it took a couple of weeks for the frequency of my headaches to go back down to normal even after only one dosage of 1,000 mcg.  

It’s funny, I researched biotin on so many different websites before I started taking it and there wasn’t one mention of side effects on any of them!  I hope my experience will help others who might have this same reaction.

It used to come regularly every approx 12 hrs.My penis was very red & sore & had white things on it.The doctor prescribed tablets & anti fungal cream that seemed to have no effect whatsoever
 Approximately 1 month ago at a supermarket I bought & ate some bitter melon fruit.Not knowing it had any benefits?I then read about it being beneficial for diabetes.
 The pain seemed to go away so I told my family about it & didnt worry about it anymore.
 However after three days the balanitis came back!!!I went back to the doctor three months later asked if he could prescribe different tablets & cream.He prescribed the same tablets as before & sent me to a specialist who suggested I have a circumcision
 This scared the daylights out of me.But I remembered that the bitter melon i had taken 4 weeks prior seemed to nullify my pain considerably!
 What happens if I buy more So i went back to the shop & bought two fruits.After consuming these fruits over 4 days I noticed my pain had gone completely.The redness had disappeared there were no lumps.I am mixing these fruits now with other fruits eg apples watermelon tomatoes oranges etc because the taste is better.I am only eating the skin of the fruit.I thoroghly beleive this has completely cured me in 4 days &  will continue take daily from now on? 
 Who knows it may have also cured or helped cure my diabetes I am going back to the doctor for further blood tests in approx two weeks.The doctor did say he beleived the balanitis came from my diabetes & as it hadnt cured recommended a circumcision.",64

My hip and pelvic bones even got bigger and thicker, and spread out like a pregnant woman - permanently. I was a girly girl with a petite enviable figure, and I liked it that way just fine.

Because I had a gastric bypass 20 years ago I may be absorbing this more quickly than intended (even at half the recommended dose), but a study a couple of years back ties leucine to cardiovascular problems so it doesn't seem to be an isolated incident.

This happened again this morning as I was wearing a heart rate monitor between workouts and it was easy to see the reaction.  It passed after about 10 minutes but certainly doesn't help my workout when that happens.

Another unexpected effect was that it killed my exercise ""high""- that  feel-good feeling that comes after a good workout.  I was curious about this and it seems one of the bcaas (leucine) also blocks serotonin.  Blocking serotonin keeps you from feeling fatigue but also blocks the workout high.

This reinforces my opinion that this website is useless and incompetent. Buckwheat is a highly nutritious food made from the seeds. The hulled seeds are called groats, and the groats are what people cook or grind up into buckwheat flour.

Also if consumed as a whole leaf either steeped multiple times (Chinese method known as Gongfu) Tea  provides huge doses of antioxidents with decreasing levels of Caffeine allowing Tea to “Wake you in the morning, keep you throughout the day, and put you to sleep soundly at night.” This due to decreasing Caffeine, and the “soporific” (sleep inducing) effect of  Theanine.",2

I think it speaks for itself. I was told by my gasterointerologist that it is a great laxative. Just a word to the weary about that, I'm not sure how accurate the side effects page on this is listing diarrhea as a ""rare"" side effect, but I suppose the days where insomnia is your only company and the next day of work mocks you for it, on those days it's worth putting up with the less than pleasant side effects for the ability to stay up and get the job done. Just remember to back off the stuff when your hands start shaking, figure out how long it takes to get through your system and space out the caffeine in those intervals to avoid overdose. for me it's about 2-3 hours. Body weight plays a factor, I happen to be a lean man in his mid 20's, so you may have separate circumstances. It is easy to build up a tolerance similar to alcohol requiring substantially more to get the same effect. This also creates a chemical dependency that can cause migraines when your brain is deprived of it. I avoid this by putting up with the migraines for a few days and avoid caffeinated food and supplements for up to 3 months. After that time I generally have brought my brain's chemical dependency to next to nil and my tolerance back down to healthier levels.

Always in moderation, and remember, never do any physically demanding activities when you've taken caffeine, it reduces lung capacity and robs your muscles of nutrients causing them to fatigue very fast under strain. You can create heart problems if you are under it's effects and subject your heart to too much strain, your base heart rate is already elevated and the extra strain can be painful to endure.",24

I have been plagued by kidney stones for the past 4 years, when I was diagnosed with innumerable kidney stones in both kidneys.  In May 2018 I had surgery to remove 5 kidney stones that were embedded in my ureter.  When I went back for follow-up, I still had blood in my urine, so more tests (ultrasound, CAT scan, KUB).  Another stone; this one was 8 mm and also in my ureter.  I was not in pain, but the location of the stone was causing my kidney to enlarge, so my doctor determined it would have to be removed and scheduled my surgery for 10/23/18.  The stone had been in the same location for the previous 10 weeks, and wasn't moving at all.  The thought of going through the surgery (and the stent they insert afterwards) was enough to prompt me to start searching for any alternatives.  I came across chanca piedra.  I read so many reviews from people who claimed it worked that I figured I'd try it; I had nothing to lose except $30.  The product I bought was Stone Breaker by EU Natural (and if you are wondering, the answer is NO, I have not been paid to write this review; I've not been in contact with the company that sold it to me, and I paid full price). I took the first dose on Tuesday; taking 2 tablets twice a day.  On Sunday morning, I passed the stone.  I am still in shock.  I almost can't believe it myself.   It came out in 5 pieces, like it was literally broken up.  I know if something seems too good to be true, it usually is.  But I can state, in absolute honesty, unequivocably, that this stuff worked!

A few of the larger ones have been removed by laser and lithotripsy.   I had 4 small stones in my left kidney and one in my right remaining ranging from 3mm to about 5mm.    It was coming up to my yearly review with my doctor.  I had to have an abdominal X-ray prior to my appointment to see if the stones had grown.    So about 8 weeks prior to this I decided to try Chanca Piedra in powder form, which I mixed according to directions,  and drank as a cold tea.   I did this for two weeks. 
During the two weeks my joints ached which I felt was a side effect of the mixture and I had occasional back pain, but I was determined to see the two weeks out.   Im so glad I did, as the X-ray showed ZERO stones.  I’m thrilled to say the least!   Bear in mind that a plain X-ray is not as detailed as a scan however my doc said that if there were any stones remaining that they would be so insignificant (small) they wouldn’t be a problem.   I can recommend Chanca Piedra to anyone who would like to give complementary medicine a try before consenting to more invasive measures.   You have nothing to lose except $30 for two packets of CP.

At first I stopped taking all herbs and the antibiotic I was using for a staph infection at the time and attributed it to one of its stated side-effects.

urologist told me these remaining were small and would be  easy to pass.  i said maybe theyd be easy for you with your much larger ureter but for me they are hell on earth.  i told him when i try to pass it at home with oral tramadol or morphine i violently throw them up.  what can i do?  i asked him.  he told me to take motron and eat less meat and salt!!!    after i had told him i was taking chanca piedra he scoffed at me.  and did not treat me respectfully after that.

i was 5 weeks on CHANCA PIEDRA.  i had an ultrasound on wed and i have ZERO stones.  i did not even feel them dissolve.

She start taking chromium and other vitamins and herbs ALONG WITH HER INSULIN to try to improve her blood sugar, and perhaps improve her pancreas function. We started with low doses. After a month, she decided to stop taking her insulin and BP meds. She gradually increased the chromium (100 to 400 twice a day) and other vitamins and herbs until her blood sugar was back to normal. She was so excited. This lasted about 8 months. Then she got sick/flu/cold and her blood sugar shot up to 230 and BP increased to 170. This is where we went wrong. Instead of going back to a low dose of insulin and BP meds, she had to double the dosage of chromium to (1000mg twice a day). (We met with a naturopath and she recommended doubling again to 2,000 twice a day WHICH WE DID NOT DO) 4 months later we discovered that she had kidney failure stage 5. I suggested that she have a kidney biopsy, but her nephrologist was not helpful. Finally, we have found a Doctor that recommends kidney biopsy to try to determine what has caused her kidney failure. CONCLUSION: A moderate amount of chromium is wonderful (maybe 100 twice a day??? Ask your Doctor. I cannot diagnose, treat, cure or prescribe!). An excessive amount of GTF or Chromium picolinate can be toxic to kidneys and liver, especially with long term use. THIS IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.",41

When I stopped for a few weeks her age-related and
post TIA-mini-stroke Dementia got much worse.  Her
thought processes and mind-body connections became
very impaired making it difficult to communicate
with her effectively and difficult for her to stand or walk a couple feet.  I started giving her
the CoQ 10 again, and it was amazing.  Within 48 hours her previous physical and mental abilities returned.  She can complete her sentences which are again coherent, she can understand what I say,
and she can stand up for 5 minutes, walk across the room and even play Scrabble with me.  Without
the CoQ 10 it had become so difficult to take care
of her at home over a 6-8 week period that I thought I would have to put her in a Care Home. 
I read that Lovastatin causes CoQ 10 deplepletion
(along with the aging process).  I was totally amazed how fast CoQ 10 worked to reverse the totally debilitating process that was getting worse and worse for my mother.  With CoQ 10 daily,

I am a 60 year old female, and I have been taking co-Q-10 supplements daily for over 20 years.  I began taking it after reading a research paper that indicated that co-Q-10 might be effective in increasing immune response.  My whole life prior to that time, I was extremely susceptible to infections; if someone with the flu or a cold even looked at me across a room, I got sick.  I was constantly sick as a child, and as an adult suffered what seemed like a continuous cold throughout the winter, along with episodes of the flu, bronchitis, etc.  NOTHING helped, not dietary intervention, not the then-popular vitamin C dosage, nothing.  After several months of taking a combined dose of co-Q-10, vitamin E and lecithin (a cocktail suggested in the research paper), I noticed that I was not getting sick as often.  I have continued the same dosage since that time, and I have not had a single cold while taking it.  No colds, no flu, no bronchitis, nothing. I did suspend the dosage for several weeks two or three times, to see if it made a difference.  It did.  Caught a cold.  Started dosage again and returned to cold-free status. (I should note that after reading reports earlier this year that long-term dosage with vitamin E could be harmful, I discontinued the vitamin E portion of the cocktail.  I have not noticed any decrease in effectiveness).   So I am curious to know if there have been any further studies on this effect of co-Q-10.  Is it possible that this could be a placebo effect of such lasting duration?  What say you, experts?  Inquiring minds want to know. ^_^

It could be because CLA increases lean muscle mass. And, since even at rest,a pound of muscle burns more fat than a pound of fat, increasing your lean muscle mass helps you burn more calories. So I'm burning more calories and losing more fat. I'm sure the results would be even better if I incorporated more exercise. Right now, I have been inconsistently walking around my apartment complex (1 round only) 2-3 times per week. Before CLA, walking would help me lose maybe 1 pound in a 2 week period.

They have definitely improved, my eye sight has not changed (gotten worse) in four years since my last visit, just saw the eye doctor and told him about Vascepa. He recommends Fish Oil to patients with dry eye syndrom. 
2. Definitely can think more clearly than previous, I'm able to focus better on the task at hand, although my mind tends to wander alot. My response to people I work with is more concise. 
3. My mood is steady but depends upon the wife, she knows how to push my buttons that's for sure.
4. Definitely can see changes in my energy levels, although I haven't changed any personal habits like eating and beginning an exercise program. Still in all I feel more energetic when I get off work. 
5. Sleeping very soundly, much more deep sleep than I've had in previous years. How's that do you ask? I have better dreams, no, not Rachel Welch, just more vivid dreams, some not so pleasant, but sometimes I will wake up in a sweat, like my mind & body have been through an experience while sleeping. No, I don't become a zombie either.... 
6. I find I can relax easier. I take a break from working outside come inside, lay on the couch and I'm usually out in 5 minutes or less. I seem to want to sleep more, maybe it's because of the weather. Maybe my body is telling me something. I feel less stress. 
7. I feel a coolness internally (physically), like no heartburn, a definite cool feeling from my sternum area (solar plexis region). I can't explain it, it feels weird but in a good way. 
8. Blood work is unknown and my recent Blood test should not show a reduction because I had just started Vascepa. Don't know, next visit to PCP should be interesting. ",14

I have seen very little improvement in my Blood sugar levels with the Fenugreek treatment alone.  In fact Fenugreek tea seemed to serve as a diuretic.  

I have tried about 4 to 6 oz. of fenugreed seeds by themselves per day starting about 2 Months ago when I needed to lower my high blood pressure and for this one particular purpose, Fenugreek seeds really seem to do the job quickly and effectively.  

I would Highly, Highly reccomend them for the treatment of hypertension, at least in my situation.  I drive Tractor Trailers for a living and I have seen my blood pressure go all of the way up to 166/96 but come all of the way down to a steady 120-128/80-90 after using 5-6 oz. of fenugreek seeds per day.  They are hard to chew though and You have to swallow them, much the same as tablets with liquid.  I am now trying some fenugreek powder, which will dissolve in water very well, just to see what the effect of It really is.  
One problem with the Fenugreek seeds are that they can cause diarrhea.  The other possible side effect that I have noticed is that I think that they may have a tendency to cause depression.   

For my sexual performance, I would give this supplement 5 stars.  It is a natural Viagra or Levitra!

Overall, I have felt much better physically since I have been taking the Fenugreek seeds.
For a 51 Year old man, It has given me back 15 Years in the way that I am feeling everyday. 

Check out Your Indian food store for Fenugreek seed and powder or buy fresh ""Methi"" or clover.  This may be a hard product to juice, without clogging Your juice machine but It will give You a juice a lot like spinach. ",14

Simultaneously, my depressed mood improved very significantly. Chicken or the egg?

I take 2000 mg of omega 3s in fish oil daily with fluoxetine (Prozac) and it makes a HUGE difference.  I drive much slower, I'm much more patient, and people don't aggravate me half as much.

Fish oil works by reducing inflammation in the brain on a sub-cellular level which allows the neurotransmitters in the brain to be able function more efficiently without misfiring (which is believed to be the cause of many mood disorders).

Regardless if you're suffering general anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, or any number off issues, fish oil will only help.

Be sure to read the label, just because it says 1000 mg on the bottle means very little.  What is important are how many mg of actual omega 3s are in each capsule.  Most drug store brands have about 300mg of omega 3s and to be effective for mood disorders, you need 2000-3000 mgs of omega 3s daily.  Specifically EPA.

I hope this helps ..",6

I have low blood pressure, chlorestorel is fine. I have been taking iron, 150 mg for over two years. Everytime I stop taking it, my iron levels plummet. If fish oil prevents blood clotting, ie thickening of blood,and can cause bleeding from the liver,, would taking this krill oil be causing me to lose iron? Just wanted to chime in with my theory. I think Ill stop taking it for awhile. The body doesnt need much fat. Hormones are made from chlorestorel. But think of the body as mostly water. What happens when you put oil, in water? It floats. Think of your blood. Basically, the oil is greasing up your blood. I have read studies about vit e and estrogen that state estrogen is inactive until activated by e, e is an oil. when activated by the wrong oil, it can trigger cancer. I even wonder if the body needs ANY external oils at all. This states that the omegas are not naturally made in the body. Then why supplument them?

Michael Bloch's team at Yale found that there was no *meaningful* connection between use of DPA/EHA and these disorders.  (The article: Mol Psychiatry. 2012 Dec;17(12):1272-82. doi: 10.1038/mp.2011.100. Epub 2011 Sep 20.).

Then again, the research does indicate that omega-3s are helpful for cardiac pathology, and certainly they don't *harm* you, so I'm going to keep taking them.  I'm just going to be careful not to spend a fortune on them, and not to ignore other treatment options and put all my eggs in the Omega-3 basket.

The IBS got to the point where I was having up to ten BM's a day - not diarrhea, just constantly in the bathroom. It was miserable -it was hard to go out for even a few hours. It actually caused me to change jobs from a 70% travel position to an inside position. I saw the 2013 NEJM data on the ineffectiveness of fish oil in cardiac conditions, saw my doc and told him I was going to discontinue the fish oil because it wasn't doing anything for the triglycerides and I saw no long term benefit. 4 weeks later ALL my IBS symptoms were gone.

Estrogen binding to the alpha receptor up regulates cell proliferation while estrogen binding to the beta receptor down regulates cell proliferation. Also only one receptor is available at a time, so a phytoestrogen binding to the beta receptor also has the effect of blocking of an endogenous estrogen from binding to the alpha receptor. As such flax (and soy) phytoestrogens are anticipated to result in a protective effect with respect to estrogen sensitive breast cancer, which corresponds to the observed correlation with reduced breast cancer with increasing soy consumption.",0

While I was taking them everyday I could tell a great difference in how I felt opposed to not taking them. I got sick less and needed steroid treatments less when I had a flare up.  These worked well for me and would be a benefit to anyone who tries them. You may not need the exact same supplements I used. They wont replace your medications, but will help them work better.

I took this and the very next pregnancy was carried to full term with a healthy baby as a result.  Not only that though - my chronic fatigue, depression, neurological issues, and memory loss all immediately and dramatically improved.

Folic acid is synthetic and cheap - but it is not what the body uses.  It has to convert it to methylfolate first.

Folic Acid and 5-MTHF or (L-Methylfolate) are different substances.  I wish Web MD would not lump them together.  Folic Acid is synthetic and it likely feeds cancer cells.  Folate occurs naturally in foods.  See this blog for the explanation. http://blog.designsforhealth.com/blog/bid/115121/ Folic-Acid-vs-Folate-Part-I

I hope WEB MD clears this up.  WEB MD is a great site with only occasional  misinformation.  So WEB MD, thanks for the site.

I use Metabolic Maintenance brand, 5-MTHF, or Methylfolate, 10 mg.  This is a generic version of the medical food Deplin.  Read the reviews for Deplin on Web MD.

If you're first layer of tape is absorbent from the outside in to the skin, you can cover it with another piece of regular tape that will block the garlic juice from getting through the medical tape to protect healthy skin, just don't forget to punch a hole in that layer too before applying the bandaid.  The reason you want medical tape as first layer against skin is that it won't injure skin, which can't be guaranteed with a regular plastic tape, not knowing what chemicals were used on the sticky side.

I know it was just a yeast infection because I have had it before when I was pregnant so I tried to ignore it for at least six or seven months until one day it got so bad, I couldn't ignore it anymore. I know I need to do something but I hate to go see the doctor because I don't want to take any antibiotic as I am a believer on natural remedies. So I decided to search online for cures on yeast infections until I come across this blog that shares the same problem as I have. They mentioned the topical effectiveness of fresh garlic but I decided to use the Garlic oil High Concentrate Extract capsule 1000mg. I broke 2 capsules and apply it topically after washing twice a day and orally take one capsule twice a day. I gradually fell better and experienced total relief from itching after around 2 to 3 days but I had also noticed that I felt more energized and more alert than usual. I felt so good overall that I decided to continue taking at least one capsule before bedtime. I also used to have a borderline blood pressure like between 120 to 130 systolic and 80 to 90 diastolic.

The supplement I was looking at says, ""Siberian Ginseng"" Ant- stress helps improve mental and physical performance. It was $12 so I grabbed it. 

Anybody who knows me will tell you, the easiest thing for me to say in a conversation was ""I'm so tired""! (and I was.)

This supplement makes me feel like I'm 18yrs old. I don't know where ALL THAT STRESS WENT TO! I come home and still feel like I was off work for a month, never run out of energy, you don't feel that ""stressful feeling"" anymore. This is a really really really good feeling I haven't had in 21years! Do not doubt this medication however if you take any medication to consult your Dr before taking this supplement.

I'm much improved over my worst days, and had been doing relatively well. I decided to try the extract from Siberian Ginseng because of some research I read. I started taking it in February, 2013, and forgot about asking myself whether it might be helping. About two months later I began to have more stamina, not get as sick during a relapse, and recover from relapses more quickly. I went over everything I had been doing, and thought maybe the Ginseng was doing it. There had been no other changes in my regimen. I asked my MD and he said it typically takes about three months to work, and that most people give up after about a month. That was in May. It is now December, 2013, and I'm continuing to improve. Some days I even wonder if I might be getting well. Could it be something else? Sure, but I'm not going to take a chance. I wanted to write this so that if you are thinking of trying it, be sure to give it enough time. I'm taking a bunch of other stuff, and there may be positive interactions of it with something else. All I know is that I and everyone around me is amazed at how much I've improved since I began taking it. I'm taking Siberian Eleuthero root extract powder (5:1 concentration, 500 mg per day, with breakfast. This is supposed to be equivalent to 2500 mg (of non-concentrated, I guess).

It has been about a month or less of taking the leaf and I still have at least 1/2 of the original amount left. I just thoroughly chew and swallow a small amount (about a pinch, or 1/4 to 1/2 of a teaspoon) of the leaf, then wash it down with water when I crave sweet/sugary foods/drinks (including sodas). Doing so almost completely destroys my sense of taste of sugar/sweetness, which returns after about an hour or two. The leaf itself has a very unpleasant, bitter flavor (tastes similar to the yellow sap in the aloe vera leaf), however that is not a problem for me, as it is a temporary flavor that can be washed away with water and one gets accustomed to the taste over time. The foods/drinks that normally taste great (sweet) taste very bland and also unpleasant after taking it. Ultimately, I'm very happy with the leaf & would definitely order it again, as it is not only effective but inexpensive. Additionally, it has really controlled my sugar cravings, and I am becoming healthier because of this. I just wanted to share my experience with the gymnema as I, myself, was not able to find many reviews or experiences online, so I was forced to try it out, and, fortunately, I've had great success with it. Lastly, I would just like to point out that it's best to chew the leaf form of gymnema, but also good to take the actual powdered form, and O.K. to drink it in tea, however, it is not nearly as effective taking it in capsule form. Taking it in capsule form will have no effect on your taste buds but may slightly help with controlling blood sugar levels. Though, I do not recommend capsules. The most effective ways to take gymnema would be in it's purest forms: leaf, powder, or tea. So, I hope that I've helped you in any way. Blessings.",34

Holy Basil is the first herb I have come across that helps reduce the sensation of tightness or heaviness in the chest caused by asthma, without the stimulant effect typical of asthma medications (Holy Basil works similarly to Mucinex.)

Holy Basil also reduces stress, which can help promote sleep without feeling groggy or doped up. In fact, I find Holy Basil most useful against AM insomnia (waking too early with inability to get back to sleep). 

I began taking Holy Basil, initially, as an alternative to NSAIDS because it seems to help relieve muscular pain to some extent.

I find Holy Basil works best in standardized capsule form on an empty stomach. When taking more than one capsule per day, it is possible to become hypoglycemic (for those who are prone, like me, to reactive hypoglycemia).

My most surprising experience with Holy Basil came recently when I ate something that disagreed with me at dinner.

I was also using Flonaise and Symbicort everyday since February.  I was also almost constantly taking Halls cough drops.  Coughing and congestion also kept me from sleeping at night. All the medication also made my mouth very dry. 

I got on the internet to find anything that might help and decided to get holy basil capsules (by Himalaya), astragalus capsules, snd Yin-chiao Immune Drops.  I got all three on April 11th and started taking them right away.  I felt much better with my congestion after only two days.  Mucus came out easily.  I immediately totally stopped using all the other medication.

He would manifest boils and furuncles spontaneously on different parts of his body. At one time when he was about 14 and we were managing his skin asthma wounds with dermatologist-prescribed topical ointments and cream, he developed a particular severe big boil in the middle of his upper back that hurt him a lot and made us bring him to the hospital for emergency treatment. The interns took turns in cleaning his wound by digging through his skin and even though they were generally gentle at doing so, the more senior ones had to take more aggressive action in pulling out all the pus. My son suffered a great deal of pain from that experience and I vowed to look for better treatment management for his condition thereafter. We tried applying raw honey over his next boils and we were surprised to get the following results:

1. His boil would stiffen and become painful. Upon boil break-up, we put raw honey over it. Around 5 to 10 minutes later, the boil would soften significantly and the pus turned into a lump with sufficient consistency for being pulled out safely. We put more honey over the wound of the boil and it healed overnight.

2. The success rate of this treatment has been 100% effective and has even led him to become independent at treating himself.

3. We noted that the wounds treated with honey showed generally better skin healing characteristics than with the medical ointments and creams as there were visibly less evidential scarring.

4. The raw honey treatment proved to be more cost-effective and sustainable than any of his prescribed drugs. My son also felt much less guilt over using honey than with the expensive drugs that he was previously given. This made him happier. ",0

The honey caused a very pronounced stinging that was intolerable after about an hour. I was forced to use Santyl for debridement and dressing. Later, when the wound was less inflamed and painful, I tolerated the Medihoney much better and was satisfied with it's results.

The problem is that 3 years ago I was diagnosed with transverse myelitis and have a rather large m.s. type lesion on my spinal cord.  It was an awful and very scary experience which caused some residual nerve damage. My neurologist has been watching me closely as sometimes T.M. is the first attack of M.S.. I have had generally good health in the last 3 years and have had no new lesions.  The problem is that every time I go back on inositol, which I am motivated to do because it relieves my ocd, I have steadily worsening residual effects from my intitial attack of T.M.. I have recently been taking it for about 3 months and had to stop as my legs became weaker and weaker and my balance worse and worse.  It took me about 2 years after my T.M. attack to get full strength back in my legs and to not feel and look like I  was drunk when I walked. After this recent period of taking inositol again all my walking problems were steadily coming back.  I had to stop. Two days later I feel 100 percent better.  There is absolutely no doubt to me that the inositol is causing this. When I looked this up on line to see if there is anything written to help me understand why this is occuring I did find a small bit of info saying something about how people with m.s. shouldn't take inositol because it increases killer t cells aand that is not good if you have m.s..  I don't know if theres any truth to that. I do like inositols benefits but 
unfortunately it has a serious downside for me. Just wanted to share my experience.",53

Ordered the powdered form because reviews said it was absorbed better.  It was extremely easy for him to take since it is tasteless and the product I ordered on Amazon dissolved completely in liguid.  After one dose of 600 milligrams I saw a difference and so did he.  After two, he started to say how it made him feel better.  After three (the next day) he said ""Mom, I think this is how God had wanted me to be."" which said it all!!! This has only been our third day so I am careful to say we have to see, however, his behavior explains it all.  Situations which would have surely ended up in a tantrum now can be discussed and dismissed.  He is still upset by things (doesn't like the smell of canned dog food, doesn't like leggos moved, etc) but he now has ""power"" over his decisions on how to handle the matter.  Sigh... I am so relieved!!!  If you are a parent of a child with abnormal rage then you can relate.  He has not experienced any side effects and we are now doing 12,000 milligrams morining and night.  After reading more great things about Inositol, everyone in the family will now be taking it regularly.",58

The symptoms have varied over time as I have gotten older and went from the actions and tics to a manifestation of problematic thoughts with a few lingering tics. This has been troubling to myself and my family, to the point of no end.  We were at our wits end and explored the conventional treatment, of course I don't feel the benefits out weigh the side-effects of those drugs and decided to stick to my more natural path as I do with all my remedies. I tried Inositol as a last resort and said my prayers. My prayers were answered to say the least. I experimented with the dosage, but ultimately decided that 6mg in 2mg doses, three times daily worked best for me. It honestly began working the very first day.  My thoughts were calmer, more regulated and controllable. It allowed me to stop the train that was rolling around in my head.  Inositol allows me to focus, be calm without trying, think clearly and see things for what they are, not what my OCD mind makes them out to be. I would say my symptoms have been reduced by 85-90% and after 25 years, that is substantial and I feel so blessed to have found this medication.  With regards to side-effects, when I first began taking the medication, I would get a slight headache, a little dizziness and in the evening the drowsiness was more pronounced; but after about a week, those side effects subsided.  On a different note, I have also found that my skin and hair have become healthier; I have a lot more energy; I don't crave sweets as much as I use to and it has boosted my libido exponentially. I know that each individual is different and that this medication affects everyone differently. This is just a short list of all the wonderful things that it has done for me and I would absolutely recommend that anyone with OCD try this medication. I know that it has helped me, more than I could have possibly dreamed.",142

The product was caused mild but persistant loose bowels.  Of course! That's what the word cleanse means!

I complained that I had not read any of these terms.  The girl, Stephanie, was KIND enough to read them to me.

I drove past my first bottle shop and thought, don't feel like one yet. That happened all day until 7pm came. I was relaxed and thought, I don't really feel like it tonight. Today no drink again and I'm not fazed. It's late at night, I'm relaxed and my mind seems occupied and I really don't want or have any urge what so ever. I suppose you have to want to stop. However I was trying it for smoking, and it's stopped me drinking almost immediately. There's no way ( I hope), that I will have a drink now. I haven't had it this easy.   ",83

Effects are seen immediately,person is more calm and has a better mood.  However it takes about 6 months to 1 year to reduce alcohol cravings to zero. If the addiction was a long one, I would recommend to detoxify body, to keep taking for another year. It works  as antidepressant, studies say it affects serotonin and dopamine levels in the brain. It helps shizophrenia, I know a person who feels amazing from it. Kudzu mimics estrogen ( without estrogen side effects), and estrogen is the new shizophrenia treatment being developed and worked on now.

I’ve decided to write a daily journal to track my progress while taking the Kudzu herbal supplement.  To recap, I started taking the Kudzu about a week and a half ago but not consistently.  I did notice a difference in my response to alcohol since I started taking it, it’s difficult to explain, but my need to continuously put a drink up to my lips was not there.  I still over drank two of the days but it seemed to take a lot longer to get to the point of irrationality where I compulsively keep drinking.  Also, the buzz effect I get sometimes even after one drink was not there.  I didn’t take the Kudzu consistently, even missed days, so I’m hoping to test these next two weeks taking it as they say, 2 pills after breakfast, 2 pills after lunch.  I took it yesterday and I have noticed one of the side effects is that I don’t digest meals as quickly.  It’s not quite heartburn, but like the food sits in your stomach.  I had trouble sleeping and had stomach cramps because I had to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night.  I’m hoping this isn’t regular.  I’m going to try to eat lighter at night to help alleviate.
3 weeks - Tuesday May 15th. It has been three weeks since I started taking Kudzu.  The good news is I've only over drank 3 times, which might sound like a lot but is good for me.  I've drank at cookouts, dinner, home, and a soccer game and can honestly say that the urge to overdrink was greatly diminished.  I have not been as consistent as I'd like taking the 2 pills after meals twice a day but the effects still remained.  The only real side effect I have felt is indigestion, gas and a bloated feeling, like I'm not digesting.  But I have been taking some Gas-ex and that seems to do the trick.  I'm going to keep taking it for the next two weeks and see how my drinking is affected.  It is not a magic pill, you still make the choice to drink or over drink, but I can honestly say it has changed the ""need"" to keep putting a drink to your lips.",170

It's effective in reducing the urge to drink, and if you can make it past the first couple of days, it's smooth sailing, but you must keep using it.  You are going to feel different, at first, and many will contribute this to the Kudzu itself, but in reality you've just removed an energy source -- alcohol; not a good energy source, as your body uses alcohol first for energy, carbohydrates second, followed by protein.  So if you're drinking and wondering why you're gaining weight, that would be why.  Another tip, while I'm here.. stay AWAY from sugar.  Alcohol and sugar feed the same receptors.  That's why you'll see tons of sugary treats at AA meetings.  Give up sugar and alcohol, let Kudzu feed your brain, and you're good to go.  Good luck everyone.",184

A secondary affect was during my physical workouts I find that I breath easier and can sustain cardio for longer periods without running out of breath.  This was significant to me because my asthma sometimes can slow me down and I do not have that problem if I have had sufficient L-ARGININE earlier in the day.",219

I also tried a competitor's product since the positives really had me hoping for success. I never had much of an acne issue even when younger and at my age, over 50, acne outbreaks are rare.

After painful initial outbreak and first couple of years, the symptoms settled down to once or twice a year, despite my top stress job. 
Last year had a critical turning point in life wich was very difficult emotionally and stressful financially. Then came the Mother of all vicious Outbreaks with non stop pain and discomfort for months. Of course I was very distressed and couldn't function sexually at all.
I waited in vain for symptoms to recede and didn't go see an MD because I knew he'd prescribe ineffectual and expensive pharma, so I started taking 1000 mg Lysine (thanks Google) about 30 days ago, every morning with plenty of juice and my usual daily dose 1000 mg vit.C.  The symptoms and the pain have now completely gone and I'm back to normal...

Will continue taking this therapy for another month or so, for safety, and then I'll reduce Lysine to 500 daily for another month and see what happens. 
I will of course keep taking my daily vit C as I have been for the past 25 years.
I hope this helps someone out there...",8

This was extremely embarrassing when around coworkers especially after the TIME magazine article titled ""The New Scarlett Letter"" published in 1982.   No longer was it a simple cold sore since it became an STD called Herpes.  This was the center of conversation on the late night TV shows.  My dentist gave me a prescription for Denavir (Penciclovir Cream) which worked extremely well but at a cost of about $50 for a 2g tube (about 1 tsp).  Denavir did not decrease the incidence but it did lessen the severity IF I applied it at the first tingling sensation.   I have since discovered the L-Lysine treatment and I have not had a serious outbreak for the past five years.  At the most I have one or two possible outbreak per year.   I call them possible because taking Lysine 1000 mg 3 times a day for three days prevents it from developing fully so it could have been just a cracked dry lip.",2

I am reminded of the game Pokémon. The Lysine just kills or gobbles up the virus and I go back to my normal dose. Why aren't the doctors educating their patients about this? I am guessing this would also work on genital herpes. The only time it did not work was when I started too late. Even then the outbreak was less severe and healed faster because of the extra doses.

Three weeks later I got my first cold sore and I've had them every winter ever since. 

Winter 2015 I finally figured out that my outbreaks were due to the cold snaps we get living in Florida. 

I realized that when it starts to get cold (below 50°) my lips will start to feel like a prune and NO amount of lip moisturizing helps.

 I finally realized it was the cold snaps that was changing my pH balance and breaking me out in cold sores . It took me till I was literally this age of 49 to figure this out . 

I just figured cold Soares was something I would have to live through every winter which I have until 2015.

 During the summer when I never have outbreaks because my lips are moist I started taking small doses of lysing (500 mg) and also for the first time started taking biotin for ""hair skin and nails"" (one maximum dosage daily tablet 10k mcg).

I took these two over-the-counter medicines religiously every day starting September 2016... Just before the cold season hit . I do not take them during the spring and summer because I don't breakout.

 Whenever the cold snaps DID occur I IMMEDIATELY UP my l-lysine to 3x a day ... Usually blended into my smoothies so I couldn't taste it at all... 1000 mg (yup!) each serving... morning noon night . Sometimes I even did it four times a day. (I got this 3k - 4k MG dosage idea from a holistic website).

 When the cold snap ended I DROPPED the dosage of l-lysine (any brand you want)  to normal 500 mg. 

Also Biotene is taken every day year-round with my regular vitamin supplements . If I felt like it during a cold snap I might take biotin morning and night with my l-lysine smoothie :)

 Lip moisturizers don't keep you from breaking out. This is my second year and I have had ZERO outbreaks it's awesome. Finally!!!!! L lysine and biotin.

I am 79 and I have had the problem from as far back as I can remember. At first all we had was Campho phnique (misspelled and useless) Then there was an article in Readers Digest about L-Lysine. For several months or maybe a year no drug store had any, way too much demand. Then there was no instructions on how much to take. Since this wasn't studies by drug companies but trial and error by each person. Here is what I have found that works extremely  well every time. First I have found that I have no problems with taking large doses, it just works quicker.  ALWAYS have a bottle handy, speed is important. I keep a bottle at home, at my office, AND  in my car. The MOMENT I feel one start, I take a dose.  A DOSE is 6 of the 500 mg size pills.  Put 1 on each side back on back teeth, crunch them up, almost no taste, makes them faster acting, drink lots of water. remember, 6 crunched up pills per dose.  Within 15 minutes you no longer feel the blister.  AGAIN the moment you feel the blister again, take another dose. It may be in an hour or two, BUT the moment you feel it, take another full dose. Go by the feel of the blister only. If you can feel it after 15 or 20 minutes, take another dose. When done this way, I can totally whip an attack, and no one else can even see where the blister was starting. There is nothing to heal, its over and all gone.  If they are coming again and again, after I whip it I take 1 or 2 tablets morning and night. I think I could take 1 pill per day and would never have an attack, But I only take them when I feel them coming. After reading this and thinking of people I have told about it, somehow many don't take enough or often enough. They still say that it helped. Another thing, Some called them cold sores and canker sores. I don't know if it is the same problem but it seems that the same solution might work. I sure wish I could get some feedback but that is not the way it is set up.  Good luck.",5

I took 1000mg of L-Lysine that night, and again the next morning and so on. Not sure if it helped, but I also applied Abreva for the itching and pain periodically throughout the day (about every 3 hours or so). As a side note, my last cold sore lasted close to 3 weeks even though I used Abreva early on; it seemed to almost make the sore worse, but I can't say for sure. So by Thursday, Sept. 10th, the sore was crusting, and today, Friday, Sept. 11, it's completely scabbed over. I anticipate it will we gone completely by Sunday (& I'm still taking the Lysine 2X/day). For me, that time frame is remarkable since my cold sores usually last at least 10 days! I seem to get them during high stress times, and they seem to be triggered by getting my upper lip threaded (it's like waxing but with thread); it's also currently right around menstruation for me (horrible timing for sure). At first these things only popped up every few years, but now it seems like I get them at least once a year, but this will be twice this year. I read about L-Lysine pills after my last 3-week bout, and I think they DEFINITELY increased the healing time immensely! Sometimes the sores are so painful and spread to the top and bottom of my lip (I get them on the corners of my mouth, making it hard to open my mouth without it splitting), but this time it didn't spread that far - I'd like to attribute that to the Lysine pills. As far as side effects, I didn't notice any, and I'm sensitive/paranoid about all medication/supplements. Some people recommend 1000mg 3X/day but I didn't want to do that  personally.

I keep my lips hydrated constantly (I'm the chap-stick, carmex, super lysine Queen!). And I avoid chocolate as best I can. I feel chocolate is a big culprit for these sores since its very high in arginine which is known for facilitating an outbreak. I use tea tree oil, tea bags, and ice, to soothe a sore when I get an outbreak and it seems to help. The ice helps from getting big and swollen esp if you catch it on the onset.

Late teens they got real bad,  I decided to do research and learned what triggers them like the sun, citrus fruits, nuts, tanning booths, beer,alcohol which I was doing all of regularly.

Also I learned taking lysine supplements daily helps keep your lysine level high.  You can find in vitamin  isle but I buy mine online, not sure if u can say product names on here but look up pure vitamins cuz some have fillers and look up rapid release lysine.  I use 500 mg pills because the 1000s are big.  I take 1500 before bed.  If I eat a high arginine food like popcorn I take 1000 mg more.  I take 3000 a day spread out if I get a cold sore along with zinc vitamin one a day until it's gone.  I get rare small cold sores that heal fast.  I also condition my lips before bed and during the day as needed with 100 percent clear pure aloe vera gel and then Vaseline on top.

As a teen monthly cycles made them break out, continuing into adulthood. It has been a constant battle in my life, and outbreaks came with lethargy followed by depression. I found lysine in my late 20s and was beyond happy,as it worked for many years. As I aged through menopause, the virus moved from cold sores on my lip to my gums, and the doctor prescribed Acyclovir. I had never taken a prescription for this and it was effective, but outbreaks were constant. The doctor prescribed taking it daily along with medicine for depression. The virus then rapidly moved along my nerves to my ear canal, then my sinus and behind my eyes causing violent headaches. It was debilitating, and it seemed like the medicine was pushing it deeper into my system. During this time, frantic for relief and concern for my eyesight, I learned that my extremely healthy diet - nuts, grains,etc., was food heavy in arginine that was actually stimulating the virus in my system. Even the protein powder I used for workouts was high in arginine. Immediately I changed my diet to remove all foods high in arginine, added any foods with lysine, and got back to taking lysine supplements, stopped the antidepression and Ayclovir medicines. The virus went into remission ""overnight"" and the depression lifted as quickly, life is normal after almost two years of horrible pain.

Yesterday I again took two in the morning, another in the afternoon, and a fourth tablet in the evening.

Happy to say the blister never erupted and has dramatically shrunk. I credit Lysine with turning this from a major weeklong outbreak to a couple day minimal bump that's dried up and is quickly going away.

Not sure I would take it every day, but I plan to keep it around for use at the first sign of trouble. It was about 24 hours from first tingle to when I took the first pill. My sense is the outbreak would have been lesser still had I gotten that first dose earlier.

In fact at my worst ther were multiple ones in my mouth, as large as a dime in diameter.  Dovtors had said that it 'could be' the Herpes virus, but I knew there had to be more. Well arginine (amino acid, found in dairy and wheat) was way out of check in my body and was supporting the formation of the sores!  L-Lysine controls the arginine levels and supresses viral replication associated with canker sores.  So a regular dosage of  L-Lysine will do you well!!!",7

Tried everything (eg, gentian violet smeared all over one cheek while a small child isn't an adorable look) but nothing worked. 3/4 times a year social engagements, relationships etc had to be cancelled for 2 to 3 weeks because of an outbreak. Until acyclovir, which however causes lasting redness, nothing worked, until I found lysine. Taking one 500mg lysine tablet a day every day has reduced the number of outbreaks to about one a year, and reduces the extent and invasiveness of outbreaks. Applying powdered lysine (the content of capsules) dry, direct to the cold sore, clears it up, although not as quickly as acyclovir, and is gentler on the surrounding skin. I now find that I only get cold sores if I'm very run down or if I eat a lot of arginine-rich foods (nuts, chocolate) and at the same time neglect to take my daily 500mg lysine capsule.

I have created a paste also using 1000mg pills in a small bowl with only Hydrogen proxide. Let it sit for about 20 minuts sir occasionally. Optionally you can blend the bills in a blender. But do NOT put the hydrogen peroxide in the blender. The Peroxide eats away any rubber sealings within two uses. Found out the hard way don't do it. 

And mix it in a bowl with a few ounces of hydrogen peroxide and let it sit for a little bit. Those pills don't break down easily. 

Once it is about the consitancy of milk, (there will still be big chunks of pill unless you blended it), put it all over the area infected, I myself have had it spread to my neck and check and shoulders. Leave it on for a LONG time. I leave mine on and put more coats on when it drys. Usually 2-3 coats per hour. It does hurt a bit as it tighten the skin underneath, giving sharp pulls like band aids if over joints. 

Once it completely drys out, you will be covered in white powder that was not absorbed. It will flake off in powder form. If you really want to you can try and save the powder if you have a thick coat, and use it again.

It's amazing how well it works, it turns white headed breakouts into faint red dots, not even bumps. After doing this two days, with 2-3,1 hour sessions a day, my extremely bad breakout was only little red dots.

Any ones that are left still large, Just keep using the treatment on them. I just keep doing all of the previously infected areas even if they are clear, can't be to careful it will spread or reappear. If they are very large I usually try to pop them and let them weep just a little bit, and then massage the solution into the affected area.

Word of caution, if you use your bare-hands to apply this to affected area, your hands will become very coarse from the peroxide.

This is what I do AS SOON as I feel a sore comming on, it's usually gone in a few days to a week and never gets big enough for other people to notice. 
Day 1:
At first sign of cold sore I take 3,000mg of L-Lysine with either an 8oz glass of milk or a calcium suppliment as I was advised Calcium helps your body absorb and distribute the Lysine. 
Then using 1/8 to 1/4 inch slice of a FRESH live Aloe Vera plant and apply it topically to the cold sore. After that it's smooth sailing, I just take 1,000mg between each meal of the day with a glass of milk, and once more before bed. I apply the Aloe topically as needed and drink lots of water, through out the day. 

Day 2,3,4:
I take 1,000mg with water first thing in the morning, between each meal of the day, and once more before bed. I apply the Aloe topically as needed and drink lots of water, through out  the day.

Day 5: 
I follow Day2,3,4's steps until I can feel the worst is over. Then I taper off to 1,000 mg twice a day, for two days in a row. Usually by then it's practically healed and no longer requires Lyzine. However if you feel like its starting to itch or burn again, keep following Day2,3,4's instruction until completely gone. 

**Please note:
Drink lots of water to prevent Lysine toxication (as I was advised it can cause renal failure) but also water helps your body properly utilize the Lysine. Through my own trial and error I learned processed/pre-packaged Aloe Vera products & gels do NOT work, it must be a piece from a fresh live plant. This will alleviate the itching and burning, plus keeps the cold sore from growing bigger and helps to deflate any swelling or puffiness of the affected area. Keep some fresh Aloe with you and apply topically AS SOON as you start to feel any itch, tingle, or burning. ",3

To be safe, I go down to one a day for a week after this.

I didn't have depression, anxiety, or any mood disorder; apart from the hair-pulling, I was completely healthy. After stopping Abilify cold-turkey (my doctor at the time told me this would be okay; she was WAY wrong), I experienced an intense 5-day-long anxiety attack.  Just constant panic, depression, crying, and depersonalization. On day 5, the ""episode"" ended just as suddenly as it began.

Ever since then, I'd have weeks of normalcy--even a slight euphoria--and then about 3 days of anxiety and depression that would, again, start without warning, and end just as suddenly.  Sometimes it was 3 days, sometimes more; sometimes it was so bad I couldn't function. Some episodes were more mild, but still very disrupting my life. I also began to pull more hair than ever.

I saw many doctors and was diagnosed with everything from General Anxiety, to Postpartum Depression (I gave birth a year ago), to Bipolar disorder. I knew in my heart the Abilify had caused this, somehow.

I read in a few forums about people having great success with TwinLab Amino Fuel, L-glutamine powder, and magnesium (all three taken together in the mornings on an empty stomach--I take 40 mL, 1 teaspoon, and 250 mg, respectively). I decided to give it a try, since I was desperate, and Abilify had scared me off psychiatric drugs permanently.

Within a week, I felt a LOT better. I started taking another 250 mg magnesium before bed, and now (2 months later) I feel even better, almost 100%. I do get ""twinges"" of anxiety now and then, but they are so mild and fleeting, I barely notice them; on these days I take an extra magnesium midday. I know the other supplements are helping a lot too, but the magnesium is great just by itself. It feels like I have my life back!! Highly recommend no matter what kind of anxiety you have.",73

It comes in a few different flavors (all natural), and it can be found at Whole Foods stores.  I mix a heaping tablespoon with a glass of water.  It is a relaxing, anti-stress drink, which I take at night (about 30-60 min. before bedtime),and it has helped me greatly in a number of ways:  Helps me to RELAX and SLEEP (I had been plagued with insomnia for years!), AND helps with REGULARITY (bowel movements, as I had also suffered with constipation my whole life).  I was diagnosed w/Fibromyalgia back in the early 1980's, and have tried so many different Rx's over the years, but would end up with unwanted side-effects from each med.  Now, I don't take any Rx meds, just the Natural Calm, plus have changed my diet, which has made a HUGE improvement!  If you're not familiar w/the Paleo diet, you would do yourself an unbelievable favor by checking into it.  It's basically eating REAL food, and eliminating all grains, sugars, and processed ""foods"".  Not only did it help with weight loss, but I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER in so many ways!  Less fatigue, more mental clarity, less fibro-pain, etc.  God bless each of you, in your quest to feel better and become a healthier individual!  :) ",88

IT WORKS.

But Big Pharma cannot control it, so therefore it is ""POSSIBLY SAFE"".

What a crock.

Indians have used it FOR CENTURIES.

'Big Pharma' RUINED my heart. 2 med' were mixed by a doctor who SHOULD NOT BE PRACTICING - 20+ Malpractice suits pending - but he goes on and on.

I got  antibiotic colitis, was told ""it was all my head"", and ended up with persistent atrial fibrillation. I pro-tennis athlete with ZERO heart history.

Long story short, segue 6 years LATER when I was FINALLY ably to receive treatment. My Ejection Fraction was down to 27/28%!!!

They asked if I could GET OUT OF A CHAIR, UNAIDED! I still had to work, teach, and play tennis LIKE THIS!

The cutoff for an Ablation (I wanted to start simple - not MAZE, Pacemaker, etc) was an E/F of 35%.

The surgeon told me there was ""no way"" to raise my E/F.

Started researching, and discovered a heart study with Pycnogenol.

45 days later, final Echo.

36%.

A 30% INCREASE.

Numbness? Tingling? At night, laying down?

Mine was increasing DESPITE a very successful Ablation.

Restarted Pyc', 3 x 360mg, spread out through the day.

Numbness and tingling (and right foot being colder) have dissipated to almost nothing.

My doctors are like 'ho hum', or ""hmmmmm"", but since THERE IS NO KICKBACK AS THERE IS IN ALL THE HIGH-END PHARMACEUTICALS?

You won't EVER hear about it.

Which is also why Big Pharma wants to make most 'alternative' (read: NATURAL) medicine ILLEGAL.

Trust me; If they can ban this stuff? It will come back, on TV, with a catchy little tune...PYTESTOLLLLLLL....la la la....

At $500+ a month.

Pricks.

Start reporting FACT.

I purchased a skin serum with Pycnogenol as the primary ingredient. The intended use of the serum was to calm and soothe the easily irritated skin on my face. Certain foods & environmental factors make my skin very red and inflamed, and this product claimed to help with my symptoms. Unfortunately (and shame on me) I didn't realize that Pycnogenol is derived from Pine trees. I tested positive for ""Pine Mix"" during my allergy screening but never ""put two and two together"" when using this face serum. It took me about a month of being miserable, a trip to my allergy doctor, and tons of blood work to realize that the serum was making my allergies WAY worse. The primary adverse reaction that I had was dry mouth and subtle swelling of my tongue, which was very scary. It also seemed that while using this serum (twice/ day,) I was more sensitive to other foods/ environmental factors that set off my allergies.
In my opinion, if you have any kind of sensitivity to Pine, you should stay away from this ingredient.",11

I began taking it 3 X day, religiously. Within a few weeks, all I noticed was that I wasn't drinking as much because I had become more sensitive to alcohols effect.

But it grows best in places close to the equator.it's incredibly important to do your due diligence to research what variety you intend to take and its nutritional value.the variety that grows in India is actually the most nutrient dense. And was named plant of the year in 2008 by the National Institute of Health. it has also been quoted by John Hopkins University for saying it will in fact cure, treat, & arrest over 320 different diseases.it's also incredibly important to be seeing if your variety of Moringa is in fact organic, and it has to be fully organic. Which means no pesticides, herbacides or fungicides. it's also extremely important to look at how the tree was grown, and what conditions, and how the tree was harvested, which includes how it was dried. If it was dried in heat, or in the shade. Shade drying is much more expensive and time consuming, however it is critical to keep the bioavailabilityof the plant alive and heat/sun  drying will kill all of the nutrients which will mean you're basically eating grass clippings nutrition wise.my best suggestion to everyone reading this is to do your research, look for Moringa that comes with a guarantee in from a credible organic source.my own personal experience since I started using Moringa has been: I no longer suffer from the back pain the used to experience from being hit by truck 25 years ago, my energy levels are through the roof, my son who suffered from ADD issues have had phenomenal results with his mental clarity and ability to concentrate, my 4 year old daughter won't stop going through growth spurts, and we very rarely have a cold or the flu in our house.

I worked up to 1500 mg/d of Niaspan, but cut back due to increasing flushing incidents and unusual tiredness and weekness in quadriceps.

Decreased Gemfibrozil progressively in 30 day increments(1200-600-0 mg/d) to see if unusual tiredness and muscle weakness would subside. Noticed little improvement in those areas, but Triglycerides went to 560 and LDL's could not be measured due to high
Triglycerides. It appears that for me Niaspan at 1000 mg/d is ineffective, and perhaps counterproductive compared to Gemfibrozil at 1200 mg/d.

I am slowly increasing my dosage - went from 500 mg to 1000 mg - soon to go up to 1500 mg.  I go up every 2-3 months.

The only issue that I have found is a Niaspan-chocolate interaction.  This has happened to me twice - after eating chocolate and taking Niaspan I had terrible flushing episodes that woke me up from sleep, and 8-9 hours after taking the medication I was still red and tingly all over.  Be very careful not to take the Niaspan after eating chocolate.  Other than the issues with chocolate, the flushing is not a big issue - it diminishes in incidence over time and the severity of the flushing goes down as well.",0

Similar, I suspect, as my experience would have been if taking pill with alcohol.  

Typically, I take 500mg at night with 1 aspirin (325mg) with glass of water.  I have not experienced any flushing or itching.  Sometimes, at least 1-2 hours prior to taking Niaspan and Aspirin, I will have had 1-2 glasses of wine (sometimes beer), and have not experienced any flushing or itching or other side effects.

The Flushing and Itching experienced tonight (on the 27th pill) subsided after taking an extra dose of aspirin within 10-15 minutes.

I have not had my blood workd completed since starting Niaspan 27 days agao.  

So far, the sided effects have been nill (save for the instance tonight/27th day); however, given the change in varialbes (i.e., taken with grape juice and 1 aspirin; as opposed to 1 aspirin and water with Niaspan), the Niaspan has worked for me thus far.

Niacin, by nature, is a great way of reducing your cholesterol. Many over-the-counter cholesterol medications include high does of niacin, among other ingredients. However, one of the unfortunate side effects of taking doses of niacin is the effect explained below, called ""niacin flush"".
Niacin causes the capillaries to get bigger, and the end result is the ""flush"". The increase in size of your capillaries causes, in some cases, a redness on your skin in the areas that it is occurring. This is the first part of niacin flush. The second reaction of niacin flush is the annoying, and sometimes painful itch that comes along with it. This itch is actually healthy! The reason you are experiencing this itch is because the niacin has allowed more blood to reach your cells to remove toxins from them. As toxins are carried away and your cell becomes healthier, it is finally able to ""call"" your body for help! Your body responds by sending what is called a histamine to the cell. Histamines cause you to itch, but they also allow your body to send more water, blood, and nutrients to the area that called them.
To sum it all up, the niacin flush is actually a very healthy reaction from your body! You shouldn't be alarmed when you get it; actually the very opposite! It means your body is healing itself. You'll notice that after a certain dosage of niacin that eventually you will not receive the niacin flush any longer. Once you up the dosage, you may experience it again. Your doctor can recommend a good healthy dosage for you.
I hope this helps clear up the common misconception that niacin is actually harming your body. So, when you get it, try to sit back, relax, cope with the short annoyance that it causes, and think about the GOOD that it is doing for your body. Remember, it WILL GO AWAY!

The increase in size of your capillaries causes, in some cases, a redness on your skin in the areas that it is occurring. This is the first part of niacin flush. The second reaction of niacin flush is the annoying, and sometimes painful itch that comes along with it. This itch is actually healthy! The reason you are experiencing this itch is because the niacin has allowed more blood to reach your cells to remove toxins from them. As toxins are carried away and your cell becomes healthier, it is finally able to ""call"" your body for help! Your body responds by sending what is called a histamine to the cell. Histamines cause you to itch, but they also allow your body to send more water, blood, and nutrients to the area that called them.
To sum it all up, the niacin flush is actually a very healthy reaction from your body! You shouldn't be alarmed when you get it; actually the very opposite! It means your body is healing itself. You'll notice that after a certain dosage of niacin that eventually you will not receive the niacin flush any longer. Once you up the dosage, you may experience it again. Your doctor can recommend a good healthy dosage for you.
I hope this helps clear up the common misconception that niacin is actually harming your body. So, when you get it, try to sit back, relax, cope with the short annoyance that it causes, and think about the GOOD that it is doing for your body. Remember, it WILL GO AWAY!

Sometimes I´d catch cold and have it either during it and sometimes just post-viral cough that would last for months, and sometimes my cough would trigger off during hours of stress or tension. In my case it used to be so relentless that even a cortisone would cause a minor relief, as opposed to going away completely.

Then my elder brother looked up online and found onion as a recommended remedy. To be very honest I was very skeptical of it given how many popular and centuries remedies such as ginger, turmeric or even honey had had zero effect so far.

So my brother asked my mom to dip an onion in half a glass water (it forms a very basic part the Pakistani kitchen) and after a few hours I began taking it spoon by spoon and it worked like magic. Wow, I´ll never forget that day and the immediate relief that it provided! We´d dip it overnight and I´d take it the following day for 10-12 days and the cough cured completely as I´m off it now.

On my way, I discovered how wonderfully it works even on intestinal inflammation, although I´m yet to find it being listed online as one of its benefits. No, I´m not a patient of inflammatory bowel disease, but I do have IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) and some food often cause me intestinal inflammation. So I now occasionally use it to counter that, and it is great for IBS anyway. It just can´t be made a part of the daily routine though due to the bad breath that it gives.

So, whereas it immediately helped me with my cough, through my experience I discovered two more benefits of it and I thought I must state it somewhere online as a reference for others. Turmeric too works great for intestinal inflammatiom but I can´t take that for the mysterious insomnia that it causes me each time I take that. So I´m pleased to have come to discovered about the medical benefits that I can draw from onions.",12

Its medical value is incidental, I believe, to the joy of drinking it. High quality Oolong tea can be re-steeped numerous times, up to five or six. The caffeine in the tea is extracted through the first steeping so you aren't going to be inundating your body with caffeine if you drink it correctly. I would never go with a tea-bag version. Buy loose leaf with a nice sized tea steeper and steep at around 200 degrees Fahrenheit (not boiling though you can see the little bubbles on the sides of the glass.

Some Oolong varietals that I highly recommend (for their taste, mainly)--Dragon Oolong, Milk Oolong, Iron Goddess Ooling and so many more. 

As a note, I have both anxiety and panic disorders and I don't find the amount of caffeine in the tea to aggravate my symptoms, though it does wake me up and improve cognitive function (at least from a subjective viewpoint). Also, it curbs cravings for me. I don't even think about food. I think this is as much about the satisfying mouthfeel as it is about the caffeine. 

Obviously, if you are intolerant to caffeine, you should not drink the first steeping. While I would still talk to my doctor before doing this, I have had customers with caffeine problems steep out the caffeine, pour out the first glass (or better yet share it) and then drink five more steepings. It really is hearty and fantastic.",88

I'm not a person who takes medications or natural remedies (low T was the first time I went to a doctor in 6 years), which is why I think I didn't notice a change until I stopped using it.

Even probiotics (ie. L. Acidophilus, rhamnosus, casei, etc) should be avoided (see Mayo Clinic site). When you have intestinal damage ANY thing you take and/or eat including pancreatin and probiotics, can leave the GI tract (through the tiny holes created by these damage), and go straight to your blood, where it does not belong, and can go anywhere in our body, possible causing multiple organ failure, an auto-immune attack, skin sores/itching, and/or asthma, imflamation etc. In the case of the previous reviewer’s dog, the dog’s body (actually his liver) is trying to get ride of the pancreatin in his blood though his/her skin. 

What to do? Whether is for you or your dog, you can still take very low dosages but you have to fix the intestinal damage also! L-Glutamine is great for that, specially when combine with N-Acetyl Cysteine, and Zinc. There are others that also help: slippery elm, marshmallow root, aloe vera. No probiotics for at least 3 momnths!, no sugar, no carbohydrates, specially grains! For HUMANS buy the smallest capsule size available (I re-encapsulate it myself and I buy un-diluted pancreatin) and take the mini-caps while eating so it mixes with my food in my stomach. For DOGS: buy your dog grain-free/no-carbs/low-carbs/low-sugar/no-sugar food (or cook for him, I cook for mine ?), put food in a mini-grinder, add some water (specially if dry food) and a very small amount of pancreatin and mix it well. Of course take care of any Candida overgrowth and parasites also. I do this for me and my dogs.

Best wishes!

I decided as a last resort recently to begin taking it to resolve lower back pain from a flair up of  to degenerative discs (L3&L4). It began during the Thanksgiving Holiday while I was cooking on tile floors in bare feet. Tried pain relivers for 3 weeks, and three trips to my Chirpctor--- to no avail. Three DAYS after taking Solray brand Prickly Pear, I was 80% pain free. Within a week's time, my pain was gone,and my energy was up. I had forgotten that it regulates blood sugars too, but was reminded by previoius comments here. That likely explains my increased energy. I am going to make this a daily supplement...not just when I am in pain. I know that it is helping to maximize the benefit I already am getting from my Chiropractic treatments. Over the last 12 years, it is apparent that my maintenance treatments have continued to stabilize my spine health, and low down the naturally occuring degenerative process going on in my lower back (which I believe began due to years of working on my feet in non-supportive shoes, another 20 years of too much sitting and poor posture in an office job, several clumsy falls, and other plain old silly moves). I highly reccomend this supplement to everyone! By the way....I first tried prickly pear by way of Trivita vitamin company's ""Nopalea"" drink. It's a great product also, but as a single mom with a son in college, I found it a bit too expensive to maintain my supply. Solaray's $10 bottle of Prickly pear tablets work fine for me. Good Luck!

I have been suffering from an inflammatory eye condition called episcleritis--a condition with normally  unknown causes which makes your eye all red and sore. It's not the most serious condition but it is recurring and very annoying/uncomfortable--and people always think you have pink eye (or worse). The only available treatments are NSAIDS like ibuprofen or steroid eye drops, neither of which are good for you in the long run, not to mention they don't always work well. Being Mexican I'm familiar with prickly pears (we call them tunas) but only ate them once in a long while. Recently I was looking up anti-inflammatory foods online, trying to find some kind of food or supplement to take besides ibuprofen.I came across some websites that mentioned prickly pears' anti-inflammatory properties and since I'm familiar with the fruit I decided to eat some when my eye started flaring up. Lo and behold the inflammation subsided and I was back to normal within a day or two. I thought maybe it was a coincidence  but the next two times my eye started flaring up I ate three or four of the fruits per day and again, the same positive result. It doesn't completely stop me from getting it but it has turned something that would irritate me and make me look like Darth Maul for a week or more to something that is manageable and I can nip it in the bud within a couple of days. So if any other people out there have this condition I suggest you give prickly pears a try.

I lost a bunch of weight 5 years ago eating brown rice prepared by my dad during high school. When I went off to college, I couldn't keep up the same diet and so gained back a lot of weight. Now that I graduated and living at home, I wanted to eat brown rice again but my dad decided that red rice was better for me because he knew people back in China that ate red rice to lower cholesterol. So, every morning, I grab my lunch box of red rice and cooked veggies and lean meat to work. The first day, I ate the whole box. It would've been tasteless if my dad didn't add a little chicken stock and veggie/meat sauce to the rice. The 3rd day up to the 10th (last day, today) was where I ran into problems. It wasn't that I'm unable to stick to the diet or that I lacked the will power but half-way into the meal, I had the sudden urge to run to the bathroom. For the rest of the work day, I experienced a very bad bloating in the abdominal region and became dizzy and hot for the next 5 working hours. Today, I ate a small sandwich for lunch instead and ate my red rice meal at 5 PM. I felt great and energetic up until 5. So, I thought I'm at such an unhealthy state of being that I would feel like crap around 12 PM everyday that I never suspected the red rice. At 5 PM, approximately 5 bites in, I had to run to the bathroom with-quite frankly- a bad case of the poops. During the entire drive with my brother, I was so dizzy that I threw up a little. Fed up, I google searched about any side effects to this new lifestyle that I'm engaging myself in and came across WebMD which did explain the same side effects that I was having. Whew!

So just a warning: don't eat red rice religiously because there are side effects of dizziness (sometimes severe), immediate diarrhea, and raised body temperature. These effects can last for several hours.",0

That’s the reason for the difference in prices, from $10.00 to $100.00 or more per bottle. Pure resveratrol means a product that contains only pure TRANS-resveratrol- the beneficial substance in resveratrol. One should always read the label carefully. Pure resveratrol should be indicated on the label as “Standardized to 99%” or “99% pure Tarns resveratrol”. If the label does not indicate purity information then the product may be worthless.

Most resveratrol in the market is obtained from Japanese knotweed which is high in concentration of resveratrol and cost less to produce than from grapes.  The notion that grape resveratrol is superior to Japanese knotweed is a total myth.

Allergic reaction to resveratrol is very rare but it happens just as it can happen with any other foods.  Less than one percent of users are allergic to resveratrol.  Pure trans-resveratrol is not known to cause any side effects; however that is not true with low purity resveratrol. Low purity contains emodin (natural pert of the plant) which may cause gastrointestinal problems and act as a laxative in sensitive individuals.  

Resveratrol benefits:  Resveratrol has a long list of benefits. The top benefit is its ability to prevent heart attacks and strokes.  Resveratrol is a better alternative to Aspirin. As a user myself I truly believe resveratrol saved my life.  11 years ago I survived a heart attack, and since I started taking resveratrol 10 years ago I have had not one incident related to my heart.  For me, consuming resveratrol is like a life-insurance, not consuming resveratrol is like playing roulette with your own life.  Resveratrol is beneficial to many other conditions such as: Cancer, joint disease, Alzheimer’s, liver, aging, cataract, macular- degeneration, Lyme, ant-inflammatory, neurodegenerative disease, MS, cell damage, and athletic endurance.

I take (4)200 mg (each containing 100 mg of Trans-Resveratrol for a total of 400 mg/daily). I started taking it for general health benefits. I have had no side-affects other than weight loss, increased energy levels. and less miagraines! Without dieting or exercise I have lost 25 lbs and have now stabalized at my optimum weight not seen in years. I have even tried to gain weight (as a test) by eating high fat, carbs, sugar etc at a local casino's buffet 2-3x week and my weight did not fluctuate at all! I don't advocate an unhealthy diet but it was a fun month long experiment. In addition I have had chronic, severe migraine headaches for over 15 years having at least 1-2 week requiring perscription meds. I now have only about 1 per month! From what I have read you need at least 350 mg/daily for the benefits to kick in. Make certain that you take that as Trans-Resveratrol. Since a typical 200 mg cap may ony contain 100 mg of Trans-Resveratrol 4-5 are needed daily. I take 200/mg in the morning and 200/mg before bed since the half-life in the body is said to be 8-12 hrs. This will maintain Resveratrol levels through out the day. Next week I will have my 1st blood tests for sugars, cholesterol etc since beginning the regiment and am anxious to see if there has been a change. I was borderline on both before beginning Resveratrol. I hope the long-term benefits are as outstanding. I realize that everyones matabolism is different so doseage, benefits and side-affects may vary as well. All I can say is that it works for me. I buy Country Life Plus 120 Vcaps online through IHERB as they have the best price @ only $17.50 per 120 cap bottle. Plus orders over $40 ship free but under $40 is only $3.40 for thr entire order! One bottle @ 4 per day will last a month. That is only $0.48/daily! All I can say is this workd for me and I am now an advocate. I hope this info has been helpful! Cheers & Good Health! Jerry",57

Then I read an article about skin rashes that were the result of low selenium. A doctor recommended eating two Brazil nuts per day to obtain selenium for this type of rash. So I tried this solution and much to my amazement within three days the itching stopped and by the end of a week the lesion had cleared. Then I substituted a yeast based supplement containing selenium for the Brazil nuts and the rash came right back within days. This result was perplexing. Then I tried a better grade supplement, Swanson Albion Complex Selenium and the rash cleared as it had with the Brazil nuts. So the type of selenium supplement makes a huge difference.

I don't take more however because doing this in the past caused me side effects like mild allergies.  I also only like taking this brand.  I have tried a soy with saponins for example and got rashes.  I also love what this does for my digestion.  Going to the bathroom is NORMAL and not painful.  This has helped me not have diverticulitis which I have had for a long time.  No symptoms now whatsoever.  I will continue to report whatever is going on as I continue to take these so as to help others with their decision.  Ive tried other things but nothing worked or they were awful.  I hope they never stop making this particular soy brand.  ",3

They say they are comparable to the brand NovaSoy.  I have noticed clearly that this has helped my digestion by helping me to get unconstipated.  Going is easy without needing to use a stimulant laxative which I had been doing almost everyday for a year.  So detoxing me is what they are doing.  I feel a small tenderness of a mild rash by my nose today that I think was caused by these.  So I will keep an eye on whether they are a problem that way or not.  I have taken these before several yrs back and my cholesterol at the start was 250 and after taking them it went down to 189 or less (cant remember) all I know is it was the most dramatic loss for the entire corporation as this was done through a plan for a place of work.  Nurse was shocked when I told her the only thing I did differently was take these.  Its important you all know these contain a bit of oat fiber and rice fiber magnesium silicate, mag stearate, vegetable cellulose(Capsule, and silicon dioxide.  All these help digestion too.  I also want to note the skin on my arms is not itchy as has been for a year abd the skin on the fronts of my lower legs is not dry and cracked looking and the dead skin that was on them is just falling off.  My sinuses have felt dry and gummy and sticky for a year but the last 2 days are moist and almost clear.

I assumed every brand of 'Stevia' was the same and bought a box of PurVia packets and have been using them for about a week (about 3 packets a day in a big jug of homemade iced green tea that I normally just use honey in) -and have been experiencing headaches like crazy and (sounds gross I know, but I have to put this) slimy stool and diarrhea.

I can't believe this is happening, but this is literally the ONLY thing that I have changed in my diet and I am 100% sure it has to be the PureVia causing it. I talked to my mom (at least about the headaches!) and she told me that some of the Stevia 'brands' use a processed extract called Rebiana (or RebA) and add dextrose (like PureVia does!) instead of just using the natural plant. I did some more research and it turns out that the actual plant has been used with great results for thousands of years but the RebA extract has NOT been properly studied before being released (WHY they use it instead of just what is naturally occurring is beyond me).

I started using it originally for weight loss. I am now a borderline diabetic so am continuing the treatment to reduce use of simple carbs. I also treat for hypertension and dysarrythmias all of which preexisted the Stevia use.I do not see that it has helped for Hypertension or dysarrythmias. My blood sugars are generally good. I use stevia in tea and coffee. prior to using stevia I consumed a lot of calories in sweetened beverages. I use the liquid drops and find a 4 oz bottle lasts me for months as it only takes a few drops to sweeten the beverage. I notice people on this page reporting diarrhea from stevia  but I know truvia also contains maltodextrin which is a sugar alcohol.. sugar alcohols often have a laxative effect. I have not had this effect with liquid pure stevia. I have better weight control and unlike saccharin or aspartame it does not cause a hunger spike after using it. It also does not give me the headaches that aspartame did. It has a slightly bitter taste but this is masked by tea and coffee so I do not notice it the way I use it. Also very great in smoothies I use pure cranberry juice  or tart cherry for my base which is very tart without stevia, but they are so good for you.",5

I found Truvia et al WAY too expensive so decided to take matters into my own hands. Armed with a calculator, I first of all purchased 16 oz Stevia extract with 90% Steviasoides from Mood and Mind. My aim was to produce a calibrated liquid extract that I could add to food and drink. I figured that my 1lb pack gave me the equivalent sweetening power of 350 lbs of sugar (about a 15 years supply!) and worked from there.

This is what I calculated.. add 10 grams of the above product (I have an inexpensive cooking scale that measures to 1 gram) to 700 ml water in a bottle or jar and shake well. Refrigerate. I obtained a kid's 5ml medicine dropper calibrated into 1ml divisions for $1.00 and my calculations mean that 1ml of this liquid is equal to 1 teaspoon of sugar .. and yes it works!  I have used it to make a spectacular organic walnut cheesecake, to sweeten iced tea, iced coffee, salad dressing.. I will keep a dropper bottleful in my purse for use when I'm away from home. I have also checked out research into health benefits and found that Stevia is used for treating diabetes, high blood pressure and heartburn; for lowering uric acid levels; and for increasing the strength of the muscle contractions that pump blood from the heart. As I have an inherited genetic condition called Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy and have to take a Uric Acid-elevating diuretic for the consequential heart failure, this could be a great ""treatment"" for me.. Highly recommended! ",36

In my case, a very BIG one BUT not something that overpowers my bladder-- the effect is slow and steady. Slow and steady has won the race for me. I no longer need to lie down 1x-2x times a day and have my health aid put thigh-high alternating air pump compression cuffs on to reduce my pitting edema! Freedom! One single nettle leaf tea (well steeped) every night does the trick. Take it from a true sufferer of dependent edema, nettle leaf really works well. I do NOT agree that there is ""insufficient evidence that nettle leaf [is effective] against ""water retention."" 

I'm guessing from my personal experience that SERIOUS studies would show that nettle leaf is effective for water retention!

I guess tumeric can be deemed organic, but the extraction of the concentrate is usually not an organic process- a subtle difference never noted. 
So a product that is supposed to prevent cancer can easily become one that most defintely does.
    An article by Dr. Liva ND RPh states that of the 30 turmeric products he tested, only 2 had levels near the ppm of less than 5 (USP guidelines) at near 6ppm; the next level was 18ppm on up to 3270ppm, all proven detrimental to one's health.
   Products have been recalled by Health Canada which was mandated to test supplements in 2004, some of them tumeric products because of the high levels of 1,2-dichoroethane.
  I also discovered testing is not done in the US nor is not required by the FDA which states that a manufacturer conduct tests only if they 'know' such banned substances have been used.
I assume then it pays not to 'know'. 
What manufacturer who uses a product that is cheaper will pay to discover if it is so because it used such banned substances?

Another great way to enjoy Turmeric is to make a tea.  I use one mug hot water and add 1tsp turmeric spice, 1/2tsp ginger, dash a black pepper, 1 tsp honey.  I hear the black pepper is needed to improve absorption of turmeric.

I later learned that all of the nonprescription vitamin c sold in Canada actually contains less than the amount that is described on the label as some of it goes rancid after awhile. I later learned that taking 1000 mg will still give you about 300 mg worth which is more than the recommended dietary allowance of 90 mg per day for men and 75 mg for women.

I based this trial on the reading of the new book by Linus Pauling, Vitamin C and the Common Cold. My life changed dramatically as I ceased getting colds as long as I kept taking at least 4-5 grams (4,000-5,000 milligrams) every morning without fail, and then an additional 1-2 grams after supper. Later, I found I needed more, and if I did begin to feel a virus coming on, I found that I had to take extra, up to 8 grams at a time, to stave off or reduce the impact and symptoms and duration. Often I need to then take an additional 2-4 grams every few hours in the first day or two to knock the virus out or almost out. If waiting more than a few hours when the very first symptoms begin to come on, it is less effective. If waiting more than a half a day it may do very little and you get the cold almost as you would without it. One thing I had to start doing after a number of years was take calcium and magnesium with the C to buffer it. I had big problems with ester-C and other pre-buffered C's which were too alkaline and messed up my gut worse than the pure C which is too acidic. I had to find a balance that worked for me. I have also successfully used C to stop the flu from progressing past the first few hours. C is the one vitamin I would never do without, if I could only afford to buy ONE supplement this would be it. I am amazed more people don't use it like my wife and I have learned to do, but you do have to take a LOT for it to really work this way. If you have a very direct exposure to a virus and not enough sleep, etc., then this will only do so much good, but normally it works incredibly well if you take it every day and take enough for you. There were a few times I tried stopping taking it but always got more colds again so went back.",19

I read a few articles online about how people with anxiety disorders can benefit from taking Vitamin C. So, I went out and bought some thinking that it was probably not going to work. Well, the day I bought them I took two 500 mg tabs, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. I felt calmer even the first day I took Vitamin C.

I ingest a food or substance (like maltodextrin)

none of the prescription or over-the-counter pain
meds I have tried have helped with the bone pain.
I found out that I had become calcium-depleted from heavy-metal poisoning from a medical implant.
The intense bone pain has consistently responded to Calcium Supplementation which I take along with Magnesium and now Vitamin D.  These 3 working together have helped decrease the widespread muscle pain I experience part of every day. After
years of depletion and mineral imbalances because 
to the level levels of metal in my body, it is a
daily process to keep the muscle pain away or at least at much lower levels.  I no longer experience the bone pain at all unless I forget
to take these supplements for a few days. The
muscle pain is much trickier to control but I know
from experience that for me dietary restrictions,
Calcium/Magnesium in equal amounts and Vitamin D
especially when I can't get out in the sunshine are essential in controlling the recurring widespread muscle pain/spasms.
Reading others negative experiences with Vitamin D, I know first hand sensitivity response
reactions to foods, medicines, and additives that
others handle well.  But also I notice and have
experienced myself that doctors often prescribe
very large doses for all their patients without
starting them out at a lower dose (which may even
be equally effective) to try to minimize any sensitivity reactions or adverse side effects.
After 6 months on a certain medicine, I asked my doctor if she would increase my dose a little bit.  She ""tripled"" my dosage abruptly without ""titrating"" it upward slowly as recommended. 50,000 IU sounds like a lot

Muscle and Bone Pain
Are Vitamin D Side Effects


This is a side effect of vitamin d that is not so easy to remedy and is actually a sign that you really NEED TO CONTINUE taking the vitamin d. If you experience Pain from Vitamin D this very likely means that your bones have become somewhat demineralized from having vitamin d deficiency for a very long time. When your bones are demineralized and you begin Vitamin D Therapy, this can cause calcium to begin to go back into the bones. When the calcium goes into the bones it drags fluids with it. This fluid can actually cause a small expansion of the 'collagen matrix' inside the bones and this expansion pushes out against the exterior covering of the bone which is very inflexible and has extensive nerve endings. 

When this occurs, you can experience this as bone pain or even muscular pain. If you experience new or worsening pain from taking vitamin d, it is NOT Vitamin D Contraindication, a reason to be scared or to stop taking the vitamin d. If you continue with the Vitamin D Therapy, the pain should subside in several weeks. While uncomfortable, you will be better off in the long run if you manage the pain for this time and 'get through' to the other side.

I have had bone pains and fatigue when initially taking vits/minerals but it went away after a month. I look at it like this - after exercising, the typical feeling is soreness.  Upon consumption of anything, our bodies will experience some sort of physical/emotional/biological feeling because the body is trying to ""purify"" itself.  Symptoms and side effects are not the same thing.  Check with your Dr about what you're feeling and determine whether it is due to (in this case) Vitamin D, or if the Vitamin D is rebuilding your body and the pain is just part of the process.

It is about a year ago, my doctor said my D level is only 10.xx. I still can not handle D supplement in low does after that extreme dry mouth and eyes experience at 2 months ago.

Here is what happened to me in the past 1 year. 

1. No problem when I start took 50,000 iu once a week for few weeks. Its is D3 from fish with doctor's prescription.

2. Over energy when I took it few times a week. So, doctor want me take 2000 iu daily. But, I only took 1000iu two or three times a week. 

3. Maybe dry eye (not dry mouth yet) start when I took 1000iu every other day. I know I have dry eye issue because all new contact lens cause my eye dry. But, this maybe because I am almost 50, so dry eyes is very normal in my age when I wear contact lens. 

4. Check D level again, only 25. So, doctor still wants me to take up to 2000 iu per day.

5. I start experience extreme dry eye and dry mouth after had took 1800 iu or 15000iu per day. By the way, I also start took Calcium with D at that time.

6. Finally, I called doctor, and stop taking any D and Cal supplements. 

7. After stop it for few days, no extreme dry issue anymore, but still feel dry eyes, and still not dare to wear contact lens.

8. After stop a month, I feel much better, but still dry eyes (not extreme). Check D level again, it drop back to 10.50.

9. I try on very low does D once a while, all caused my extreme dry. D 400iu supplement, a cup of milk with D, or a cup of almond milk with D for few days.

Now, I decide stop any food or drink with D supplement at least 3 months. I am not sure what I am going to next.

After my unpleasant D experience, I start vitamin supplement searching, I found a lot of supplement also contains herbs. I also found 1 of my Cal + D supplement does contains a herb which I better keep away.

Dr. took blood panel & didn’t even mention my vitamin D score @ 15. When I researched it on my own I asked for the recommended 50,000 iu (D2) once a week for 8 wks. She said “I’ve been a dr. for 30 some years & vitamins are at the bottom rung of things that can be wrong with you.” She advised seeing a psychiatrist.

I gave her the name of Michael Holick MD, a pioneer in vitamin D research who has written a book, & also the site of the National Vitgamin D Council. At 9:00 am the very next day she called in the script. She had no clue about the importance of D or how to assess the numbers from the test. Apparently she did the research I had requested- thank God.

A tip for not having side effects with the high D dosage- take it with a large, fatty meal. It’s a perfect excuse to cheat & have fried foods or lots of butter without guilt. I have had no side effects by doing this (I think I read it on Cleveland Clinic or Dr. Holick’s site). Not through my regimen yet but am feeling brighter with more energy.

Just like educating my Dr., I plan to spread the word to everyone I know about the importance of D deficiency and how it also eventually leads to other serious illnesses. I live in Ohio & heaven knows we don’t get sun for a large part of the year. I am also fair skinned, so slather on the sunscreen in the summer. My body probably could never produce enough D on its own with these circumstances.

One dr. who has done many studies is calling D defiency an epidemic in this country, and unfortunately most doctors haven’t heard anything about it. It’s up to us to educate them!

I wish you all well, Ceci

He told me to take 3000 IU's a day for a month, and at the follow-up appointment, check for progress. He also told me to use Psyllium Husk 3 times daily for the IBS.

After reading all your posts some people need to do a bit more research on Vitamin D dosage. There are 2 types of Vitamin D in the body. Vitamin D2 is created by the body and then gets transformed to Vitamin D3. Thi 50,000 IU of Vitamin D is Vitamin D2. This creates a high level of Vitamin D2 but gets slowly converted to D3. Vitamin D3 is what the body uses and no Doctor would ever give someone 50,000 IU of Vitamin D3. It takes months of a high level of Vitamin D3 intake to create toxic levels. So rest assured the 50,000 IU of Vitamin D2 is safe. I am being treated with 50,000 IU because I have had muscle spasm and bone pain for 8 years after I was finally diagnosed with Vitamin D Deficiency (20) I have to take it once a week and have only been doing so for 1 weeek. I did notice some severe muscle twitching, but it was in the areas that I have severe muscle spasm (trigger points). Twitching to me indicates that the D is working because the muscles are reacting to something foreign to them. Also, with any treatment, one should always give the treatment at least a month before discontinuing. We must remember that our bodies are lacking something that it needs and when our bodies get ""used"" to not having this, it will react as if it is a foreign substance and eventually our bodies will get used to the higher amount. I only gave three stars because I have just started the treatement. I will update after the treatment has completed.",193

When I first went to her she tested my thyroid because I was exhausted all the time and have body pains. My thyroid was l-o-w and am now on a 50 mg pill a day for that. I have hypothyroid (according to others I've talked to, this is not unusual as you get older). Due to this, my doctor started testing my calcium and Vit D.

I ached from my neck to my toes and had a very severe burning sensations in my bones. I felt as if my body was on fire. I have gotten some relief from  the burning sensation and the pain is somewhat better.

I have been taking Vitamin D supplements for several years now...and my body tells me if I do not take it....my levels were really low...and took a long time for me to tell a difference...the last Vitamin D check I had...my level was still in the low range....

The doctor put me on a 50,000 iu for a short time...and then I started taking the over the counter doses...I am now taking 5,000 iu a day...and my pain is so much better...I have done quite a bit of research on Vitamin D...and low Vitamin D can cause all sorts of other illnesses as well...I encourage everyone to do your own research on Vitamin D and how important it is for you....

I tell everyone I talk to about how important Vitamin D is....and I will continue to do so...I am living proof that Vitamin D is important....I have now seen liquid Vitamin D...so if you are having problems taking the soft gel...perhaps try the liquid D....and as with every thing else....this takes time and effort so that you can ""feel"" a difference....

NOTE*****I would encourage everyone to always take Vitamin D and Calcium together...and to eat something....I eat a bit of peanut butter or honey over oatmeal with mine....so very important...

Have been taking Rx for 18 years and it DID save my life. Got better, but still never really felt 100% at any time over the years.

I read about Vit D3 deficiency (http://www.vitamindcouncil.org) and got tested (using the correct test (25-hydroxyvitamin D test, also called a 25(OH)D ) . I was woefully deficient (28). Need to be in the 50-80 range, so started with the 2,000 IU/day and then found the 5,000 IU pill at iHerb.com (FYI: use DAH122 for $5.00 off your first order - my gift to you, :)  ) 

Since taking the Vit D3, my mood has dramatically improved - to the point that I am NOT taking any pharmaceutical Rx for depression for the first time in 18 years! I am truly amazed. Also, my overall health is better, my 'bad' cholesterol levels are dropping, no colds - not even the sniffles - since taking Vit D3. I've LOST approx. 25 pounds (read this may be due to NOT TAKING the anti-depressant). 

I will continue to take Vit D3 until I die. Absolutely remarkable results! Living in MN coupled with Scandinavian heritage, this vitamin is a MUST. I would recommend you get your Vit D3 levels checked.. and remember, if the lab you Dr. uses is Quest, then you have to multiply your results by 1.3 to get a more accurate result. Quest Labs have 'issues' and  yes, you can Google it for yourself. And don't listen to those that say a range of 30-40 is 'normal' and 'fine'. READ the results of the clinical RESEARCH, even if it is lengthy and technical.. Please don't be swayed by the pharmaceutical companies (and the FDA's)disinformation.  Take charge of YOUR life and do the research! You'll be glad you did.

The brand I use is not listed (Healthy Origins), so I just picked one.

Problems included: severe fatigue, muscle pain, severe joint swelling and pain, bone pain, ""foggy"" feeling, sinus problems, ear problems, a positive ANA test result and breathing problems.  I've tried multiple treatments through several doctors and specialists.  Switched to a new doctor and - during intake - found low Vitamin D levels.  Doctor prescribed 100,000 IU's to be taken one time each week for four weeks (to be retested following).  Initially, I experienced an increase in pain, almost like a tenderness all over my body.  However, the joint swelling, pain, sinus, and several other problems have subsided and the tenderness is getting better.  It wasn't overnight, but I am getting better.

I would highly recommend this treatment.  I know some of the prescribed levels sound scary, but it has helped me to finally experience relief after 10 years of pain...and the level I am taking is short term.  Please stay at it as best you can, I experienced relief from my symptoms and I believe that you can as well, but you'll need to stick with it.

As an aside, my doc says if my numbers check okay at the end of treatment, then I'll move to a 1,000 IU daily supplement.

My best to you!",3

The only reason I rated the ""Effectiveness"" section with 2 stars was due to the fact that I haven't completed treatment yet. I haven't noticed any changes with my symptoms, but I'm not sure if my symptoms are due to the D deficiency and I'm only half way through the prescription I was given.  I know many people are hesitant to take 50,000iu (as I was and to be truthful it still gives me pause every time I take it) and I wanted to share my experience with others who are deficient. 

From all the research I have gathered over the last several weeks of reading up on the subject of D deficiency - this is something people shouldn't take lightly.  The medical community have finally realized that D deficiency leads to a whole host of medical problems.  Vitamin D can not only provide treatment for some conditions, but actually prevent others from occurring in the first place.  I couldn't deny the facts and knew I had to take this or possibly deal with greater problems in the future as a result of depriving my body of something it vitally needs.  

One other point I wanted to mention for others who might be going through the same experience I am and that's Vitamin D deficiency and an underactive thyroid.  The information on a possible connection  between the two conditions on medical sites have been sketchy - it's alluded to in some writings, but nothing concrete is documented.  Maybe it's wishful thinking on my part that the D deficiency is the cause for the thyroid problem, but only time will tell.  My thyroid is a little underactive, but yet my thyroid antibodies test is negative for hypothyroidism.  So, again, maybe there isn't a link between the two conditions. 

I will give another update if anything new happens, if not, I will give a final entry at the end of October when I go for another set of blood tests to see if the D has increased my numbers.",65

I think your doctor wants you to either take the 50,000 units weekly or the 400 units, daily.  You don't have to take both.  Start with the prescribed dose. You are usually only prescribed for a short time period.  If it's too much, or you don't feel good on it, cut back to the 400 units daily.  I am increasing my dose to 800 units slowly.  It has a nice side effect of lifting my mood.  Buy a good brand of over the counter D3.  Make sure your get the D3 and the other forms of D are synthetic. Susan",36

The d-alpha E is the active form, and more recently the d-beta, d-delta, and d-gamma have shown specific antioxidant properties. We need all four, but only in the d- form. Look for GAMMA-E or MIXED-E. Read the label = (don't get dl-form)

After a month's interval, I had a strong urgency to go to the bathroom.  This is not presumed to be entirely normal, so I assumed that this was for me a normal metabolic outcome.  I then tried vitamin K2 in supplement form, which I found to lower the heart rate and blood pressure.  But after a time, about 6 weeks,  just 100mcg a day caused restless muscular reactions in my legs.  I switched to 30mcg K2/25 IU MCT Oil Base Sublingual when required.  This was a significant improvement over the supplements, and I was required to administer very judiciously just one tiny drop under the tongue.  This sublingual strategy was so that the K2 goes direct into the blood stream and not processed thru through the liver.  I probably don't require very much of either K2 or D3 noting metabolic effects with supplements such as becoming constipated or having a strong urgency to pee or restless legs, and have probably filled out my requirement.  Noted effects on stopping K2/D3 sublingual was mild heart palpitations, so I will continue in small, judicious amounts and carefully monitor.  Would recommend Boron supplements according to dosage recommendations, or perhaps Potassium Gluconate as they take far longer to fill out the basic requirement.

 After many years of frustration with conventional medicine, I started researching my symptoms on line,( skin pain, joint pain, neuropathy, fatigue, weight gain, and more). My reading led me to vitamin D3 and more reading led me to believe I needed K2 to direct vitamins and minerals from my blood stream and into my bones.
 I went to see my family doctor to ask if she would check my D3 levels, as I intended on increasing my intake to see if it helped my symptoms. 
 I have limped for well over a year due to Mortens neuroma in my left foot. Within a month of taking the D3-K2 combination I have stopped limping. My D3 levels are fine so I plan on increasing my dose to see if there will be more improvement. So far the only side effect is with the D3 (stomach ache, if taken without food.)

Even after stopping my daily weight lifting program three months ago I am still having normal, pain free, diarhea free daily bowel movements so it was not the exercise that contributed to my beating IBS.

 I have advised others to try it and they have reported the same results as myself. I have no idea why it works, I just KNOW that it does for me and perhaps it will help you as well.
For more info please watch my video on YOUTUBE titled BEAT IBS with WHEY PROTEIN.

Good Luck and my greatest hope for you is that you too can FINALLY lead a normal life as I do now!
