medicines to just 3 of them plus vitamins.  She
takes 25 mg lovastatin, 2 baby asprin and 25 mg
sertraline.  I had been giving her CoQ 10 as well.
When I stopped for a few weeks her age-related and
post TIA-mini-stroke Dementia got much worse.  Her
thought processes and mind-body connections became
very impaired making it difficult to communicate
with her effectively and difficult for her to stand or walk a couple feet.  I started giving her
the CoQ 10 again, and it was amazing.  Within 48 hours her previous physical and mental abilities returned.  She can complete her sentences which are again coherent, she can understand what I say,
and she can stand up for 5 minutes, walk across the room and even play Scrabble with me.  Without
the CoQ 10 it had become so difficult to take care
of her at home over a 6-8 week period that I thought I would have to put her in a Care Home. 
I read that Lovastatin causes CoQ 10 deplepletion
(along with the aging process).  I was totally amazed how fast CoQ 10 worked to reverse the totally debilitating process that was getting worse and worse for my mother.  With CoQ 10 daily,
(and blueberries) my mother is 96 years YOUNG again.    I have learned the hard way (both for myself and my mother) that it is very important to
thoroughly research how one's medicines may be negatively interacting, (causing reduced or increased absorption or other side effects) and how some medicines can result vitamin and mineral
deficiencies.

After discovering that statins like the Crestor that I take reduce CoQ10 as part of the same process it used to reduce cholesterol -- and Coq10 is needed to produce the ATP that muscles use for their energy, I tried it.  I  saw an immediate and very significant increase in strength.   Admittedly, if I had been sedentary, I probably would not have noticed a difference.   There have been trials that proved this affect, but the medical community tends to ignore them.

I started with 200mg once a day but found that the affect wore off.  So I have been taking 200mg twice a day (using Jarrow's formula)",44

I am a 60 year old female, and I have been taking co-Q-10 supplements daily for over 20 years.  I began taking it after reading a research paper that indicated that co-Q-10 might be effective in increasing immune response.  My whole life prior to that time, I was extremely susceptible to infections; if someone with the flu or a cold even looked at me across a room, I got sick.  I was constantly sick as a child, and as an adult suffered what seemed like a continuous cold throughout the winter, along with episodes of the flu, bronchitis, etc.  NOTHING helped, not dietary intervention, not the then-popular vitamin C dosage, nothing.  After several months of taking a combined dose of co-Q-10, vitamin E and lecithin (a cocktail suggested in the research paper), I noticed that I was not getting sick as often.  I have continued the same dosage since that time, and I have not had a single cold while taking it.  No colds, no flu, no bronchitis, nothing. I did suspend the dosage for several weeks two or three times, to see if it made a difference.  It did.  Caught a cold.  Started dosage again and returned to cold-free status. (I should note that after reading reports earlier this year that long-term dosage with vitamin E could be harmful, I discontinued the vitamin E portion of the cocktail.  I have not noticed any decrease in effectiveness).   So I am curious to know if there have been any further studies on this effect of co-Q-10.  Is it possible that this could be a placebo effect of such lasting duration?  What say you, experts?  Inquiring minds want to know. ^_^

Because I can only take Tylenol and narcotics for pain relief I had to stop taking NAC since Tylenol and NAC  cancel each other out. My father with Asperger's took 1200 mg NAC daily for the last three years of his life. I provided him with NAC so he would continue taking it. What I noticed is the my father was noticeably happier since he no longer had OCD in the form of obsessing about past events ad nauseum and talking about it incessantly while taking NAC. My father's mother also exhibited that behavior. I could not get my son to take NAC. Since he is bipolar type 1 as well as has Asperger's a dose of 2400 mg/day is more in line with his needs. My son also has the form of OCD where he would obsess over past events. Being impulsive this type of OCD can get him into loads of trouble - interpersonally and with the law.,38

In April 2010, Korean researchers reported on the action of NAC in combination with a proteosome inhibiting chemotherapy drug known as MG132.

 

 First they showed that MG132 increased the amounts of ROS in lung cancer cells and as expected, the drug slowed the rate of growth of the cancer cells. Then they treated the cancer cells with NAC.

Four months is plenty of time for it to take effect and Vitacost usually has very good and reliable quality supplements. I actually started with 3600 mg for the first month. I have not felt any improvement from NAC as an add-on to my other meds. I was hopeful and there are several studies attesting to its efficacy. Even some psychiatrists are recommending it to patients. I will probably keep taking it for a couple more months until I use up my supply. It supposedly has high antioxidant potency, so it might be benefiting my health in other ways, but I still have mild to serious depression. You mileage may vary. And WebMD really needs to add depression or bipolar depression to the list of possible reasons for using this supplement.",102

I based this trial on the reading of the new book by Linus Pauling, Vitamin C and the Common Cold. My life changed dramatically as I ceased getting colds as long as I kept taking at least 4-5 grams (4,000-5,000 milligrams) every morning without fail, and then an additional 1-2 grams after supper. Later, I found I needed more, and if I did begin to feel a virus coming on, I found that I had to take extra, up to 8 grams at a time, to stave off or reduce the impact and symptoms and duration. Often I need to then take an additional 2-4 grams every few hours in the first day or two to knock the virus out or almost out. If waiting more than a few hours when the very first symptoms begin to come on, it is less effective. If waiting more than a half a day it may do very little and you get the cold almost as you would without it. One thing I had to start doing after a number of years was take calcium and magnesium with the C to buffer it. I had big problems with ester-C and other pre-buffered C's which were too alkaline and messed up my gut worse than the pure C which is too acidic. I had to find a balance that worked for me. I have also successfully used C to stop the flu from progressing past the first few hours. C is the one vitamin I would never do without, if I could only afford to buy ONE supplement this would be it. I am amazed more people don't use it like my wife and I have learned to do, but you do have to take a LOT for it to really work this way. If you have a very direct exposure to a virus and not enough sleep, etc., then this will only do so much good, but normally it works incredibly well if you take it every day and take enough for you.

I have tried just about every vitamin or supplement that is said to help anxiety...Valerian Root, 5 HTP, B complex caps, and a few others. None of these supplements helped my anxiety like I'd hoped. I read a few articles online about how people with anxiety disorders can benefit from taking Vitamin C. So, I went out and bought some thinking that it was probably not going to work. Well, the day I bought them I took two 500 mg tabs, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. I felt calmer even the first day I took Vitamin C. I have been taking 1000 mg for the last few months and can't believe how I feel. My symptoms of OCD and Panic disorder are greatly reduced. I feel more calm now and I don't get stressed out easily anymore. I would recommend that anyone struggling with an anxiety disorder at least Give Vitamin C a try.

I took this and the very next pregnancy was carried to full term with a healthy baby as a result.  Not only that though - my chronic fatigue, depression, neurological issues, and memory loss all immediately and dramatically improved.

Folic acid is synthetic and cheap - but it is not what the body uses.  It has to convert it to methylfolate first.

Folic Acid and 5-MTHF or (L-Methylfolate) are different substances.  I wish Web MD would not lump them together.  Folic Acid is synthetic and it likely feeds cancer cells.  Folate occurs naturally in foods.  See this blog for the explanation. http://blog.designsforhealth.com/blog/bid/115121/ Folic-Acid-vs-Folate-Part-I

I hope WEB MD clears this up.  WEB MD is a great site with only occasional  misinformation.  So WEB MD, thanks for the site.

I use Metabolic Maintenance brand, 5-MTHF, or Methylfolate, 10 mg.  This is a generic version of the medical food Deplin.  Read the reviews for Deplin on Web MD. 

 I have just started using it so I can't tell if it is working.   I just wanted to clear up the misinformation of folic acid versus folate (l-methylfolate, 5-MTHF).",12

  BUT THIS IS THE SHOCKER!!!!  I have learned that Folic Acid feeds cancer cells and helps the cancer to grow.  Now they have found a way to use this to help in surgery.  It is important for the surgeon to get all the malignant cancer cells during surgery.  So they mix a bright glowing dye with the folic acid and give it to the patient.  When the body processes the nutrient it goes straight to the cancer cells and the doctors can recognize the malignant tissue that they want to cut out because the cancer cells light up from the glowing dye in the folic acid.  The healthy tissue around the cancer is not affected because the cancer cells feed off of the folic acid to grow. The folic acid is drawn to the cancer like a magnet as it feeds on the nutrient to grow.  IS THIS TRUE??????  Why oh why aren't we notified of the dangers with some of the vitamins out there?

I saw some relief, and was able to reduce the Neurontin somewhat. Symptoms returned to their previous state in about three years. I then found out about sublingual METHYL cobalamin b12 --  methyl b12. There is no apparent upper limit; I am symptomatic unless I take 150 milligrams/day, an enormous amount. I use Natural Factors sublinguals, 5000 mg tablets, and take 10 between my cheek and upper teeth, three times a day, usually at night. I built up to that dose gradually, according to whether symptoms had disappeared. Anything less methyl b12 and neuropathy -- pain and tingling and numbness in my feet and legs -- is back. Cause of neuropathy? I've had different diagnoses, but now it's more plainly Sjogren's Syndrome. I no longer have repeated falls due to numb feet. I can wiggle my toes again. BUT the first four weeks on b12 is no picnic; brain fog and headaches, for me. Very very difficult for people taking antidepressants, and of course you should stop taking PPIs, because they destroy b12 in the body. These changes are difficult; the rewards of taking b12 are tremendous, and many people don't need the amount I take. The best protocol for starting methyl b12 can be found online by searching for Freddd and b12. Medically necessary for people with stomach stapling or other reduction in stomach size.

Sometimes I would get background headaches that would be on and off for several days. So we tried taking butterbur as soon as I got any early warning symptoms. Almost invariably, if I take it within half an hour of early symptoms, the migraine stops completely within 15 minutes. More than 3/4 of the time, if I take it after early warning, when the full headache starts, the migraine intensity is lessened significantly. Often, this is the difference between days of pain, and sleeping at night.
I don't take it every day as a preventative, just when I get symptoms or know I will be around a lot of triggers.
