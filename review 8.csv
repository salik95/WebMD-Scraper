Today is the 4th day of taking 5-HTP. I still feel sad, have negative thoughts and bouts of anger, but they quickly dissipate and no longer linger on to consume me like what they used to. There’s this sense of calmness that is allowing me to make sound judgements and decisions without being hampered by negative feelings all the time. I feel like the decisions that I make will lead to positive results, as opposed to bad endings that I used to feel prior to taking 5–HTP.
Might be too early, but I can safely say that I am no longer a victim of my own depressive thoughts.  I am no longer a person who is constantly sad and angry. The only flip side is that 5-HTP does wreak some havoc in my stomach and I feel bloated with gas at times. But it does seem to feel less intense as the days go and I am hoping that my gut will get used to this supplement. 
Overall, what a miracle supplement. My only regret is that why didn't anyone informed me about 5-HTP earlier. I feel as if so many decades of my life wasted on being weary all the time and so many days and opportunities to seek happiness were missed. Nonetheless, better late than never.

I experienced results within three days of taking 50mg once a day in the AM. It works for me, YMMV. The mood effect is subtle but consistent. My mood feels more stable, particularly more resilient. I have fewer anxiety spikes.

I didn't take it for sleep disturbance, but it has improved the quality of sleep significantly. I wake up much earlier and without grogginess when I've taken it the day before. I also have dreams that I remember. Part of the stress resilience I feel may come from the effects the 5-HTP has had on my sleep.

It's probably not a plug-and-play supplement that can safely be taken on its own. Do your research. I take l-tyrosine with it (to prevent dopamine depletion/imbalance). The recommended ratio is 10:1, but my body seems to do better with 5:1. Because 5-HTP can cause heart valve damage via increased peripheral serotonin, I take EGCG (which effectively neutralizes the peripheral serotonin that doesn't make it past the BBB) and omega-3 (to increase bio-availability of the EGCG).",5

I've tried medications from my doctor but they make me feel fuzzy minded and kinda (zombiefied) so I quickly stopped them. After starting 5-HTP within days my mood changed drastically. I took one pill in the morning on a empty stomach and about a hour later I felt so much better, positive and happy. When I wake up in the morning I feel like I've had a great night sleep.

The 2nd day I had severe numbness and tingling in my feet and up my legs. My arms were becoming numb too. I looked it up on the internet and found that this herb can cause an incurable disease called EMS (Eosinophilia Myalgia Syndrome). People have died from this disease. In 1989 there was an outbreak of it from Tryptophan. Numbness and tingling in the feet is one of the symptoms. I was scared to death. I waited a week to see if the ""pins and needles"" went away but they didn't, so went to an Urgent Care. They took my blood and urine. After 5 days they told me that my test results were normal but wanted me to get tested again. Now after 3 weeks the pins and needles are going away. I seem more sensitive now to other side effects though. I would never touch this again. L-Tryptophan is the same thing. I think it should be banned.",1

I used 5-HTP a few times before but it was never when I was really depressed so all it did was give me a calmer feeling and slight contentment. This week I started using 5-HTP again, with doses averaging 300-500mg a day. By the very first few days I have already noticed an increased mood, and more positive thinking. I had already begun a change in my mentality before the 5-HTP that was pulling me out of my depression but the 5-HTP just catapulted me straight upwards and I feel that it is speeding the process. Somedays I just look around me and am in this feeling of wonder and aliveness. It's like that feeling of life has been handed back to me. It's very meditative. I would recommend this BUT I am worried about heart valve issues if used for a long-term time, so I will be weaning off of this slowly now as I believe I have already gained what I wanted from it. Though I do think the heart valve damage is very unlikely with normal use, as one study I read used HEROIC doses on rats for 3 months, no human being is likely to be using such doses so as long as you make this a short treatment, it is wonderful!",39

I feel it's my duty to let everybody know that 5-htp actually works. I'll be honest with you and admit that I've been experimenting with MDMA, which on some occasion brought me lows (depression) for a few days after consuming it. Hearing it can help manage those symptoms, I decided to buy it. (It's really a harm reduction strategy and not an encouragment do to MDMA!)

Since buying 5-HTP, I've taken it twice, and NOT after MDMA but while completely sober and feeling fine, and unexpectedly it made me a whole lot more content and healed some low level anxieties. It actually made me feel good and not crave any kind of drug to make me more happy (i.e. alcohol, tobbaco, MDMA). It's not that I'm an addict by any means, but I often have this desire to get f****d up for no good reason really. It also made me sleep a whole lot better, without waking up during the night, and the dreams were crazy vivid and life-like but I liked it, it's interesting. Oh yeah, and there were some ""side effects"": sleepines, perhaps not feeling mentally as sharp, feeling a bit mellowed out. Well, it's not that any of these are bad by themselves, but they can sort of have an effect on your productivity. Taking it before bad is probably the wisest, so you sleep it over. :)

I forgot to mention: The first time I took 200 mg and I think it was a bit too much. I was feeling very balanced and in good mood, but overpowered by side effects. Second time it was 50 mg before sleep.

I'm not saying I'll start to use it regularly, but I can see it's potential for reducing depression and anxiety. It's legal and it really does have an effect which is definietly not placebo. I personally could probably reccomend it even for just having fun or relaxing. Why not take 100 or 200mg and chill out with friends? It does have some slightly euphoric effects. IMO far better and helthier than drinking booze or doing some drugs to achieve that feeling or get rid of anxieties. Just a thought!

Wish you the best :)",8

Effects usually hit 2-4 hours after taking it: general boost in mood, difficult to think negative thoughts, warm fuzzy feeling, sometimes even euphoria. Feelings of love, from loving what you're doing, to feeling better about people around you. Similar feeling to MDMA. I don't know why, it might just be my experience, but the effects seriously last 3 days or so. Then for about 3-4 more days just a general content feeling. After about a week you're back at baseline but I swear that's better than before when I never took any anti-depressants. 

BTW, messing with serotonin is dangerous, why I've never sought to get prescribed SSRIs or anything. That's why I only take 1 100mg pill every few days, it only takes a small amount to change the balance of serotonin in your brain. It takes other chemicals in your brain to work....so too much, and you might not even feel the desired effects, just the bad side effects. 100mg/day to me would be crazy. Side effects include a stiff jaw/temples, headaches, stomachache, vomiting, and can last as long it takes for your body to clear all the serotonin.

I have been struggling with depression and anxiety lately and decided to go back to taking this after losing all motivation for things and needed a ""pick me up"". My previous experience I used the recommended dose of 100 3x a day and it caused me to have more anxiety and lethargic feelings which I cannot surely say it was from the 5-HTP. However, this time taking it I have found a sweet spot in dosing and it has kick started a incredibly productive time full of optimism and positivity. I am pretty impressed to say the least. That one little pill a day has caused me to completely turn my mood around into something so positive so that I could go about my day with productivity again. I can also note that my sleep schedule and problems with insomnia have completely dissolved allowing me to have peaceful yet deep slumber every single night. I go to sleep and wake up in the same spot! I wake up feeling ready to start the day instead of wishing I had a few more hours to sleep. A side effect to take into consideration before trying out 5HTP is increased dreaming. It caused my first full blown lucid dream and has made my dreams more lucid and intense. To me it was a good side effect but it may be bothersome for others. Overall, I will continue to take one a day and see how far this goes. ",118

i also suffer from terrible pms( worsened due to hormone imbalance caused by endometriosis and ovarian cysts): whole spectrum of moodswings.I would yell at people,unable to stop myself,after i have yelled at them,i would sit and cry,because it feels awful to know why it happened,but that i wasnt able to stop myself,i would end up selfloathing and hating myself.

Also I'm having a hard time going to sleep and staying asleep these last 3 days- often times having to stay in the living room to avoid tossing and turning and waking my bf up. Hopefully 5htp is the answer for those extreme mood patterns without having to go on ant-depressants with crazy side effects- I am going to give it two weeks to really see if there is a result. On top of that I eat pretty healthy and seek spiritual help- (although clearly this is not enough- I feel I really do have a serotonin level that needs to be adjusted) Also I really hope this insomnia goes away after my body gets more used to taking 5htp- I'm going to start taking it in the late afternoon instead of night to see if that will help.

I have been on and off antidepressants for years, but nothing has ever 'worked'. I would give up on them after a few months, until things got absolutely unbearable again & would finally drag myself off to the doctors to try another one. Even St Johns Wort had awful effects, and I essentially got to the point of accepting my perpetual unhappiness, and considering suicide as inevitable & the only option for future relief. 
Until.... 5-htp. 
I am extremely aware that everyone reacts differently to different chemicals, but for me, it has been a godsend. I take 2 x 100 casuals at night, and from day 3 onward, I have literally never felt better.
 I sleep, have lovely calm dreams (as apposed to constant nightmares), wake up energised & I am happy & completely at peace. 
I have suddenly & completely gone off sugar, and although I am not overweight, I have lost 3 kilos in 2 weeks. 
This would actually be my only warning; if you are someone who struggles to gain & retain weight, I would be careful on 5-htp & force yourself to eat, even if you don't want to. 
Other than that, I have had a 100% positive experience with no side effects whatsoever, & I would encourage anyone who has depression to give this supplement a chance.

100,1,3/17/2015 1:26:45 PM,Depression,"5htplover, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Consumer)",5,5,5,"I have been on 5-HTP for nearly 8 years, and much happier for it. I started it after my boyfriend died unexpectedly and I fell into a severe depression (normally I suffer from mild depression). I didn’t have insurance, and started researching alternatives to SSRIs. I had taken Zoloft for a spell years ago and it worked for me okay (though I didn’t like the side effects). The day I started taking it it worked! I was able to get out of bed and do the dishes, a major accomplishment at that time in my life. Over time and with an increased dosage, my depression and anxiety lifted and my concentration and focus improved. It also helped my sleep, and I didn’t experience a decreased libido like I did on Zoloft.

My advice:

1) Work with your doctor if you want to try this. Do not take 5-HTP with other meds unless instructed by your doctor as this can cause bad interactions (e.g., see #3 -serotonin syndrome).

2) Start with a low dose and work your way up. I started with 50 mg. Over time I upped it by 50 mg increments until I found what worked for me (150 mg once a day). 

3) Serotonin Syndrome (where getting too much serotonin is toxic) is real, but from what I have read you have to take 300 mg or more before you see toxic effects. This information may change over time as research teases this out, and I suspect it differs depending on the person. 

4) Take an enterically-coated version of 5-HTP. This means it breaks down in the intestine and not the stomach. After a year or so of taking uncoated pills, I started to experience stomach rumbling and discomfort, and a low-grade fever. The enteric pills eliminated this issue. 

5) Get a good quality product to ensure you are getting a pure product. I take Solaray. 

6) If it makes you sleepy, take it at night. I initially tried it on a Saturday day, when I knew I’d have the day off and could see how it made me feel. It made me drowsy. I now take it ~45 minutes before bed and that’s worked well for me.",171

WARNING if you are prone to bi-polar or manic phases then very carefully watch yourself and get a good friend to keep an eye on you.

Initially, some nausea and headaches and fatigue, as well as difficulty staying asleep through the night.

Because I'm still having some mild panic sometimes during the night, I'm going to gradually increase the dose - taking 50 mg in the morning and 50 mg at night.

Don't rely on ultra-conservative sites with no scientific references that support the evidence they propound. Shame on you WEB MD. Stop being driven by pharmaceutical bias and money.",6

It did lift my mood and suppress my appetite but the side effects were not worth the benefits of taking it. 2 days after taking 1 pill per day in the morning I woke up and felt my face twitching. It was more than just twitching, I thought my face muscle was going to pop put of my skin. My face was twitching on the left side below my eye. This continued off and on during the day. I kept taking the 5-HTP in hopes that this was just a fluke and was not related to taking it, although 5-HTP was the only thing I was taking prescription and non prescription.The twitching just became worse and my muscles became very sore primarily in my arms.This twitching would move from one area of my face to another. I had no idea when it would happen and it was scary. I stopped taking the 5-HTP and all of these symptoms stopped. I really wanted to be able to take this because I felt so much better and I believe my family noticed the improvement in mood. My dose was 50 mg per day. I may try it again one dose 1- 2 times a week instead of every day. So far I haven't tried it again. I'm really surprised more people haven't commented on the negative side effects of this.

If you are experiencing anxiety, mind racing, etc after being on 5-htp, this is often the symptoms of serotonin syndrome. It means you do not need that much.  Some of these doses are crazy.  You should also drink green tea eith your 5-htp to protect your arteries (theoretical side effect).  A side BENEFIT of green tea is that it has theanine which will increase other brain chemicals that might be low.  I suffer from moderate to severe depression at times, and can only 50 mg for about 3-4 days before I start suffering from anxiety.  Then I'm good for weeks.  Take your 5-htp...not too much...for whatever amt of days. As soon as you start getting s/e's, this is your threshold. Do not take again till the benefits wear off.  You'll have to play around with this.  I suspect some people may be more sensitive due to various reasons. Maybe even methylation problems.  Also remember serotonin ain't the only kid on the block.

WATCH YOUR DOSAGE!!!   I cut a 100 mg tab into quarters and take only 1 daily, with very rare taking 2, so that is only 25mg daily normally.    Great treatment, but the dosage may be what causes so many of the problems people describe.   Who ever said that 100mg was a 'correct' dosage so that so many people take it as a minimum??!!??    And taking multiple dosages, or multiple times daily....talk about too much of a good thing!!!   Get a pill cutter, or split your capsules.  

I can feel the impact of the treatment within 10-20 min, calming my anxiety.    I usually take around noon.   Have GAD and have had panic attacks.    Xanax was horrible.  Dropped it quickly....thank God.   Since starting this 5htp treatment, and taking some GABA only at bedtime which I added to the mix about a year ago, no panic attacks at all.  Anxiety, but no panic.    

I do take 10-15mg amitryp at bedtime, which is a VERY SMALL dose, not therapuetic accoridng to Doc, but am very careful still with 5htp and the ami.    Never taken together at same time or too close together.   

I would recommend 5htp without reservation for anxiety, but at a smaller, more controlled, dosage.   ",42

Because of its chemical and biochemical relationship to L-Tryptophan, 5-HTP has been under vigilance by consumers, industry, academia and government for its safety. However, no definitive cases of toxicity have emerged despite the worldwide usage for the last 20 years.

I noticed the results within 15 minutes! I felt a calm that I have not known for YEARS! I was just peaceful, kind of like I didn't really care about anything, but I DID still care; I just wasn't hyper-vigilant, or uptight about anything!

No side effects yet, but I have only taken it for about 3 days. I haven't taken more than 1 100mg capsule a day yet because I haven't felt the need to.
Do be warned, however, 100mg makes me a little sleepy (I weigh 190lbs); combining 5-htp with drugs that enhance drowsiness could be disastrous under the 'right' conditions! ",46

It acted like a stimulant for me and I even had trouble sleeping the first few weeks. However, others have told me it had the opposite effect on them so I hypothesize that it depends on your already existing serotonin levels. 
I did experience headaches at first but they have now gone away. This did concern me an I would like to know more about the cause.
I also ate less at first, but I now seem to be normalized. It wasn't like being on Ritalin or Adderall where you feel shaky and  the idea of food is repulsive. It's very subtle and you only eat when hungry without overdoing it.

There was a scare about 5HTP in 1988 due to a contaminated batch from Japan, coming from the labs of Showa Denko caused 37 deaths and 1500 permanent disablements. 
Controversy at the time between big pharmas, the biotech and FDA resulted in a blanket ban of 5HTP. Pharmas would rather sell you the more expensive SSRI's. Biotech don't want you to know it was Genetic Engineering caused the problem. FDA played safe and banned everything just in case, or maybe under direction from lobbying by big P & BT.
User consensus says 5-HTP is very helpful, and videos on youtube from qualified professionals saying so. 
Me? I found it immensely helpful and get mine from a reputable source. 
If I hear that ""voice of depression"" I take 2 x 50mg tablets of 5 hydroxy tryptophan in the evening, it gives me a great night's sleep, possibly because it also converts to melatonin and significantly elevates my mood in the morning, presumably due to increased serotonin levels. 
I wish WebMD would update their statement to ""avoid"" this very helpful food supplement, and stop misleading people who need help, but they have not responded to my attempts to contact them with links about the original 5HTP contamination. 
Don't cross medicate with SSRI's or MAOI's and it is probably perfectly safe.

A lot of nights I couldn't get to sleep until 4 or 5 in the morning and then I could hardly function all day.

I started taking a sleep aid that contains 10mg of 5-htp and what a difference! the very first night I went to sleep easily without tossing and turning for hours as I usually did. I have been sleeping through the night and rarely have to get up. My dreams are not upsetting anymore and I feel very well in the morning. This very tiny dose works for me and has made a big difference. I tried taking a sleep aid that didn't contain 5-htp to see if it made a difference and after one night I went back to taking the aid with the 5-htp because the 5-htp does make a difference.

I had been reading about 5-HTP and seeing the results from comments such as below have been having on peoples lives so decided to try for myself.. what did I have to lose right.. ? My MD had scribed Xanax for me... but it was really causing me to detach from life altogether.. 

I was at Costo last week and found Natrol 5-HTP - although dubious yet excited.. I tried the product and have been taking it for a week.. 

Well I honestly have to say.. WOW.. what a difference... No more Mr Snapper Head and now I am feeling like ""normal"".. I have no idea how it performs on appetite control as I am a foodie.. but I can say without a doubt that my mood has lifted and I am out of my funk and thats after 1 week.. I have found that the stupid small stuff in life that would occupy my mind for no reason at all has pretty much gone.. I have started to accept things for what they are and move on.. instead of dwelling and festering on things.. 
So - my opinion - for what it is worth.. go to Costco or the drug store - try it for yourself.. I think you will see a difference.. as so many people like myself have.

I am heading on a family reunion vacation in a week.. my Sister said.. ""bring your Xanax"" - lol - nope - ""ill bring my 5-htp !""",239

With a terminal parent, a new baby and a full time job . . . I never had an oppurtunity to deal with all the emotions and eventually, it hit me like a ton of bricks. 

I didn't even know there was a problem until I had a severe panic attack and ended up in the emergency room. I was put on antidepressents (Lexapro originally and Zoloft after) both of which gave me severe panic attacks and anxiety 24 hours a day. I went from functioning to nonfunctioning almost immediately. I began not being able to sleep and having severe migraine headaches. 

I have begun taking 50 mg of 5-htp every other night along with a multi vitamin and fish oil daily. Of course, I have also done behavioral cognitive therapy and have seen a social worker but I have noticed an amazing difference in my depression and my anxiety has almost completely lifted. I am sleeping again. I feel like myself again only better. I am happy and I truly think it was all of these things put together but 5-htp had alot to do with it.  

I will say that I am 24 years old and am 5'3, 120 lbs. The first afternoon I took 100 mg and it was way too much for me. But the side effects were still not as bad as the antidepressents. I do currently still get headaches almost everyday; however, the duration and severity has improved. Hopefully at some point, these will go away too!

It matters what you get and the level of potenctcy and purity. I have used Thorne in this product and truly has made a profound difference in my life. I take 1 3 x a day and the max I take is 2 3x a day. You can build it up gradually and it can also be a 2x a day am and pm or lunch and dinner. Mild depression and anxiety I have had for many years and this along with a reduction of refined sugars and more quality protein and lots of veggies has changed my life. I have had no side effects from this brand.It should also be taken with B6 for better absorption and this brand has the B6 in with the 5HTP.

I also had a sebaceous cyst that cleared while taking chlorella. It does give me more gas and bloating and that is because its working to clean up the mess in my gut.

I think I experienced the serious negative side effects almost immediately after consumption.  I needed this product to help me detox ""toxins"" in my body -- mainly, candida and possibly mercury. I am also trying to decalcify my pineal gland. I so needed this product and wanted it to work in that I tried using it on 3 different occasions (varying the dosage)but with ultimately the same results.  Taking a lower dose, I was less sick but experienced the unpleasant side effect of nausea before the other symptoms hit.  The main unpleasant symptoms?  Repeated vomiting and severe diarrhea (coming out of both ends simultaneously -- I know, too much information).  Retching to the extent of having a sore throat the next day.  Lying supine on the bathroom floor for hours feeling intensely weak and ill.  At least, when I lowered the dose I didn't think I was going to die for the side effects and they did not last as long (3-4 hours vs 8 - 10).  My belief is that supplement worked but that my system is so riddled with ""poisons"" that the die-off (mainly of candida) was too much for my system to handle.  I experienced similar symptoms when I finished the protocol of hydrogen peroxide (food grade) therapy but that took 3 weeks to build up to the dosage that would cause the candida to ""die-off"" which of course, inundates your system with toxins and feels like (I imagine) heroin addicts must feel when they detox -- it is a living nightmare and you do feel like you may not survive it.  I wish I could tolerate the yaeyama chlorella that I took because I think it does its job, its just that the side effects are immediate and intolerable and consistently happen.

It is very important to start very slowly with the smallest dose possible and then build up the doseage.  Note your symptons and if you experience sickness, know that it is caused by the release of toxins.  You may have to stop for a few days, or unti your system settles down, and then begin agin.

I was surrounded by people with the stomach flu most of the holiday season, and I am happy to report that I am so far flu free. I haven't experienced any major side effects. I started with 2 pills for 2 days, didnt notice any major symptoms, 3 the next two days, had some 'detoxifying' results. Bumped it to 4 for a day and now have been at 5 pills since (my bottles suggested amount) There are definitely some detoxing effects, but I haven't felt even close to projectile vomiting or a need to wear depends like previous reviews. I believe a lot of side effects are psychological. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 star effectiveness is because I have only been taking it a few weeks.

Since I'm an organic eating vegan and consider myself very healthy and relatively detoxed already, I haven't had any real side effects. I could see, however, experiencing some rather uncomfortable headaches and nausea if you are very toxic in your system and then slam in the Chlorella all of a sudden.

Before taking Chlorella, I took Klamath Blue-Green Algae for years. Like all algae supplements, it's very important that you get a product that isn't contaminated.

In my experience, it's the contaminated products that make people experience the harsh symptoms like nausea, vomiting, etc. As WebMD states in their own description of blue-green algae in general, ""blue-green algae products that are contaminated are LIKELY UNSAFE...Contaminated blue-green algae can cause liver damage, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, weakness, thirst, rapid heartbeat, shock, and death. Don’t use any blue-green algae product that hasn’t been tested and found free of mycrocystins and other contamination.""

I guess others who wrote about having these symptoms might just be allergic rather than hitting upon a contaminated product, but for me, I've had no problems with the Yarrow Formulas so far. Only time will tell, as I just started on this one, putting it in my morning smoothie along with Reishi, Chaga and Astralagus Root.",31

When I stopped for a few weeks her age-related and

thought processes and mind-body connections became
very impaired making it difficult to communicate
with her effectively and difficult for her to stand or walk a couple feet.  I started giving her
the CoQ 10 again, and it was amazing.  Within 48 hours her previous physical and mental abilities returned.  She can complete her sentences which are again coherent, she can understand what I say,
and she can stand up for 5 minutes, walk across the room and even play Scrabble with me.  Without
the CoQ 10 it had become so difficult to take care
of her at home over a 6-8 week period that I thought I would have to put her in a Care Home. 
I read that Lovastatin causes CoQ 10 deplepletion
(along with the aging process).  I was totally amazed how fast CoQ 10 worked to reverse the totally debilitating process that was getting worse and worse for my mother.  With CoQ 10 daily,

thoroughly research how one's medicines may be negatively interacting, (causing reduced or increased absorption or other side effects) and how some medicines can result vitamin and mineral

I am a 60 year old female, and I have been taking co-Q-10 supplements daily for over 20 years.  I began taking it after reading a research paper that indicated that co-Q-10 might be effective in increasing immune response.  My whole life prior to that time, I was extremely susceptible to infections; if someone with the flu or a cold even looked at me across a room, I got sick.  I was constantly sick as a child, and as an adult suffered what seemed like a continuous cold throughout the winter, along with episodes of the flu, bronchitis, etc.  NOTHING helped, not dietary intervention, not the then-popular vitamin C dosage, nothing.  After several months of taking a combined dose of co-Q-10, vitamin E and lecithin (a cocktail suggested in the research paper), I noticed that I was not getting sick as often.  I have continued the same dosage since that time, and I have not had a single cold while taking it.  No colds, no flu, no bronchitis, nothing. I did suspend the dosage for several weeks two or three times, to see if it made a difference.  It did.  Caught a cold.  Started dosage again and returned to cold-free status. (I should note that after reading reports earlier this year that long-term dosage with vitamin E could be harmful, I discontinued the vitamin E portion of the cocktail.  I have not noticed any decrease in effectiveness).   So I am curious to know if there have been any further studies on this effect of co-Q-10.  Is it possible that this could be a placebo effect of such lasting duration?  What say you, experts?  Inquiring minds want to know. ^_^

I believe the initial problem started because of a statin drug I was taking and I assumed if I stopped taking the statin the muscle pain and weakness would stop but it didn't. As this was unusal I researched looking for anything I could do to relieve the muscle problem and Ubiquinol(Kaneka QH) worked.

Soon I started experiencing side effects: extreme fatigue (not attributable to dehydration)and cardiac arrhythmia (namely premature ventricular contraction -PVC). The PVCs occured in a isolated, but relatively frequent fashion (about 10 per day). I'm not sure if there was some kind of interaction effect between fatigue and PVCs. What I know is that I have always had irregular heart beat, and I guess it has played a key role in PVCs onset.",44

I was buying DHEA supp from my (old) rhumy's on site store and was still testing low for DHEA. Got my act together and went to Johns Hopkins. They said you just never know what you are getting in supps since they aren't regulated (wonder why I kept testing low?).
NOW that I am on prescription I can definitely tell a difference!!!  This is why you get a prescription! After 3.5 years I am actually sleeping, my energy is better, I am starting to do some exercising without it feeling like I shoveled snow for hours afterwards. So that should help with putting on some muscle mass. Which means in the long run it will help with osteoporosis. The doctor who saw me at Hopkins (the Director of the Lupus Center) actually did studies on DHEA herself. I cannot recommend trying this enough, it will change your quality of life. I have not experience any aggression, etc. Also, I am sorry the other reader experienced a DVT, but we don't know all the facts. We do know that just by having Lupus that a lost of us carry the marker that already increases our odds of having a thrombotic episode by 50%. Those are just the cards we've been dealt. :( So a lot of drugs will increase our risk no matter what - a life of risk vs reward.

I noticed the DHEA was keeping me awake and switched to taking it on awakening. Immediately, I had much more energy (how I NORMALLY felt years before). The energy lasted until shortly after lunch time. As such, I started taking another 25mg with lunch. This kept my energy levels normal most of the day. Mostly, I didn't take any DHEA in the evening so as not to affect my sleep. But if I was going out with friends in the evening, I would take an additional 25mg at about 4pm.  I took this twice daily (occasional 3x daily) DHEA for about 5 years when I noticed that it no longer supplied any additional energy. My energy levels are now  pretty much back to normal, which is probably why DHEA was not providing any additional energy. I've since stopped taking DHEA several months ago and have not noticed any drop in energy. If my energy levels should drop in the future, I will definitely try DHEA again.

I was athletic for my first 25 years, but I liked the creamered coffee, beer, and pizza way too much.  
At 40 years old I tried to lose weight by working out and just trying to watch what I ate.  I had some success weight training and using eliptical machine but it was really, really hard. I stuck with it for 6 months.  I was tired all the time and everyday I dredded my workouts and felt worse afterwords (tired, and slow to recover) thinking I'm too old for this. 
--I failed!--  
Now I'm 48 years old and feel like if I don't do something I'll never see another 10 years...seriously!  I started obese @ 306 lbs, 5'-8"", lethargic and, dull of thought.  I started NutraSystem and needed a vitamine suppliment.  Went to GNC and picked up the over 40 MegaMan w\25mg DHEA and added another 25mg DHEA because of the salesman's advise.  After 2 weeks of dieting and supplements I started working out.  I've droped 25lbs after one month.  My wife says that I go into everything at 3rd gear and thinking about it I started working out hard right out of the gate.  I know that the weight loss came from my diet but the weight training and eliptical work I've been doing for 2 weeks has never been easer.  I'm not kidding...my energy level, endurance, muscle mass, power, and recovery time is astounding.  I KNOW it's not the placebo effect or the diet that's making my workouts easier and more productive.  
It is the DHEA!  
I'm still leary about all the negative side effects that I've been reading about but in my obese state I'll take a chance on the possitive changes that I've been seeing and feeling.  I'll make sure to write back if any symptoms or issues start.

True that I was 36 the first time and 40 the second time (that's why I put the 35-44 age range below, but I'm actually 50 now) - maybe a bit too young for a man to take DHEA, as there is supposed to be still a lot of it naturally, but I seem to be oversensitive to it.

However, having taken it for maybe 20 years now (ever since Effexor came out), the brainfog, memory isses and other side effects were killing me. 
After reading a lot of abstracts via Google Scholar, I found a couple of studies where DHEA was successfully used as a first-line med for treatment resistant depression at fairly high. For the past six weeks or so I have been taking 100 mg a day (single morning dose) Swanson's brand and during that time I have managed to reduce my Effexor dosage to a single 150 mg capsule a day. 
Doses this high would not be viable for a younger person with high natural DHEA, which decreases with age. 
But I am a 50 year old woman, and restoring my DHEA to youthful levels seems to be working splendidly. 
(it is recommended to have your blood level DHEA checked before beginning supplementation and periodically after that, particularly if you are male).
Anyhow, no side effects whatsoever, my energy level has improved, very glad I tried this. 
In fact, DHEA is working so well that I have just begun taking my Effexor capsule every other day.
fyi, I do take a number of other high-quality supplements that are probably also helping, including 3 max strength fish oil capsules a day. ",35

One thing I *suspect* GB has done is to reduce the severity of a poison ivy rash. I get it late EVERY winter, and this year was no different...except in the severity. I still have the rash and redness all over my arms and some on my legs. However, there are no oozing, weeping blisters.

Last year, it was so bad that it went deeper than the skin and ate into my flesh in one spot...leaving a scar that's still there today. This year, it itches very little, the rash isn't very raised, and as I said, absolutely no blisters.

I'm wondering, because the GB plant can cause an allergic skin reaction, much like poison ivy...is it possible that ingesting the supplement has helped my body counteract the effects of poison ivy?",4

I didn't have depression, anxiety, or any mood disorder; apart from the hair-pulling, I was completely healthy. After stopping Abilify cold-turkey (my doctor at the time told me this would be okay; she was WAY wrong), I experienced an intense 5-day-long anxiety attack.  Just constant panic, depression, crying, and depersonalization. On day 5, the ""episode"" ended just as suddenly as it began.

Ever since then, I'd have weeks of normalcy--even a slight euphoria--and then about 3 days of anxiety and depression that would, again, start without warning, and end just as suddenly.  Sometimes it was 3 days, sometimes more; sometimes it was so bad I couldn't function. Some episodes were more mild, but still very disrupting my life. I also began to pull more hair than ever.

I saw many doctors and was diagnosed with everything from General Anxiety, to Postpartum Depression (I gave birth a year ago), to Bipolar disorder. I knew in my heart the Abilify had caused this, somehow.

I read in a few forums about people having great success with TwinLab Amino Fuel, L-glutamine powder, and magnesium (all three taken together in the mornings on an empty stomach--I take 40 mL, 1 teaspoon, and 250 mg, respectively). I decided to give it a try, since I was desperate, and Abilify had scared me off psychiatric drugs permanently.

Within a week, I felt a LOT better. I started taking another 250 mg magnesium before bed, and now (2 months later) I feel even better, almost 100%. I do get ""twinges"" of anxiety now and then, but they are so mild and fleeting, I barely notice them; on these days I take an extra magnesium midday. I know the other supplements are helping a lot too, but the magnesium is great just by itself. It feels like I have my life back!! Highly recommend no matter what kind of anxiety you have.",73

I have found a and was told by a specialitst that you need to start with a small dose of magnesium once a day (ie: 250 mg) for a few days and then increase it to twice a day.  Gradually increase the doses until you reach the peak of diarrhea; then back the dosing down until it subsides. Stay on that does awhile and if needed, try taking the dose up gradually again.  I take a 1,000 mg twice a day and it helps with feeling less stressed as well.  Also, for you chocolate cravers...magnesium is in chocolate and magnesium does help reduce and even eliminate cravings, which is different than having a urge to have some chocolate and being satisified.  My friend teases me and says why takes magnesium when you can eat chocolate????  My blood work has been perfectly fine and, as always, discuss this with your MD first.  Not all MD's will support this idea or even understand it (I am a Registered Nurse).  I don't mess with other products as I am on Paxil, which reduces the amount of Aleve I need for the fibromyalgia and, it helps the depression.

However, a year ago I began experiencing issues with peripheral vascular disease associated with varicose veins (ulcerations and subcutaneous bleeding on my calves, joint pain and stiffness, planar fasciitis and chronic leg cramps). 

Within weeks of treating my varicose veins with compression stockings and elevation, I noted increased postural tachycardia, which became debilitating after 3 months (could no longer work). While waiting to see my PCP, I came off the melatonin and both my tachycardia and varicose veins began improving significantly. Three weeks after discontinuing its use, the tachycardia disappeared and the varicose veins improved enough to allow me to go without compressions stockings for intervals of several hours.

Have found nothing to explain the correlation but for a study in European Journal of Phramocology, vol 345, 1 March 1998 (NIH medical journal database), where the authors discuss the presence of MT1 & MT2 receptors (to which melatonin binds) in smooth muscle of vascular tissue and their role in vasodilation and constriction, respectively, as an explanation for melatonin’s systemic efficacy.

While my overall condition improved when I discontinued use, I did experience a brief period of cognitive impairment and an uptick in mean blood pressure, the latter of which may require me to seek treatment should it persist. Finally have a follow-up with a cardiologist.

One 3mg brand I like is pretty consistent for me (and $3/month! cheap!), but the same brand has a few other doses, plus a ""dissolvable"" 3mg dose with sweetening added, and of course all the bottles look the same, so I've accidentally bought the wrong ones (or if the right ones were sold out, tried another dose): ALL the other doses of the ""good brand"" didn't work. And the sugary one gave me the ""nervousness"" effect.

After a few YEARS of trying melatonin for sleep (on and off), though I have a decent one now, I really think the FDA should be looking at what these vitamin companies put into these pills. At least there should be consistency from ""batch to batch"" (same brand/dose).

So when you hit luck with a good one, it's very effective. But it really feels like a crapshoot when you open the next bottle. I'd love to put my brand/dose as 5-star satisfaction, but since this review is just ""melatonin"", I've got to consider the rest of my experiences with melatonin. Mostly positive, but even the few times I've gotten ""the jitters"" ...why package and sell a sleep aid that makes insomnia a nightmare? It makes it tempting to go back to prescription meds (where the FDA at least has a say).",69

I didn't relate to the melatonin because I never heard of it causing diarrhea. At first the diarrhea was off and on, I guess because I only took the melatonin twice a week. But this past month taking it every night I got diarrhea so extreme after anything I ate.  I'd take Imodium and then I wouldn't go for two days and when I went again, it was diarrhea. So I googled melatonin to see if anyone else was having this same experience and Lo and behold I saw I wasn't alone. So I stopped taking it and no more diarrhea!

I like that it is not addictive. I particularly like it when my schedule is irregular and I need to get to bed earlier than normal for an early am appointment. It gets you sleepy in about 20 mins. (of course it's best to start settling down for the evening). It is a dream enhancer though, the higher the dose as in 5-10mg the more one will tend to dream. This can make one feel as though they haven't slept. Best to start with a small dose and increase until you find a dosage that makes you sleepy in the 20 min range. Then go to bed. If you don't your body will just work it through and it will do no good. I also like to combine this with Valerian root which produces a sound sleep. Also non addictive. One of each on any given work night is about the right dose for me.  The melatonin dose is 1mg and the valerian is 500 mg.  I have taken up to 10 mg of melatonin with no ill effects, however you will need 8-11 hours of sleep with that dosage and you may still wake up groggy. I have also taken up to 2000 mg of valerian root with no ill effects and no grogginess (in case you have never taken valerian root it smells like dirty socks, really dirty socks lol).  Both products are relatively inexpensive. My size is 5'4"" and I weight around 145-150. Judge your dosage according to your size. I have used nearly all makes and models of both products",13

Added 50 mg Bendryl (diphenhydramine)per night a few years ago and have not needed to change either dose since. I sleep through the night and wake up refreshed but sometimes a bit groggy. A good cardio workout takes care of that. Very important - try cutting down, or better, eliminating caffeine. 
I've tried a number of brands of melatonin, but many don't work. I've settled on Natrol, because it works. There are probably others that work also, but I haven't seen any reason to experiment unless/until the Natrol becomes unavailable or stops working. Remember that these are not manufactured as drugs and there is no required test for what's in the tablet. If the first brand doesn't work for  you, try others until you find one. That doesn't mean you will necessarily succeed - melatonin doesn't work for everybody. Try it, though. Start with low doses and adjust as you see how it affects you. Good luck!",54

Rather than put me to sleep it woke me up and gave me moe energy in the first few hours after taking it each night my dreams or rather My nightmares were much much more vivid  and memorable, before this i cannot remember having or at least remembering any dreams in the last 6 months. When I did sleep, every third day or so, my sleep was much shorter topping out between 3 and  hours. Then for the 2 days after I stopped taking it I slept about 21 hours a day and was extremely groggy when I was awake (afterwards, that is after the 2 day snooze fest, I returned to my normal insomnia problems.)But the worst side effect, reportedto me by family and coworker, was that while I kept taking the melatonin I was extremely irritable, easily annoyed and angered, not to mention so energized and thinking and talking a mile a minute most of the time when I had to be really alert for work, I guess to compensate my groginess (a sort of adrenaline rush of some kind and I imagine it was like some people feel when on speed or something, or immediately after coming off of it. It got so bad at one point that I was suspended for three days from my management job because I scared an employee and maybe even a few.

1564,16,4/28/2014 9:01:30 PM,Benzodiazepine withdrawal,"John shepherd, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months",3,5,3,"Benzodiazepines cause tolerance and physical dependence within two to four weeks, and, upon cessation acute withdrawal traditionally requires tapered management. Additionally in some long term users experience withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal syndrome can last many months and is typified by a major depressive episode, agitation, and lack of ability to get to sleep. This is a serious side effect which needs careful monitoring.
ol
For this reason Benzodiazepines need to be used with extreme caution and for very short periods.

Melatonin is effective for sleep disturbances that are not caused by an over active nervous system, such is in the case of Benzodiazepine withdrawal. It appears virtually ineffective during acute (tapered) withdrawal, although somewhat helpful during withdrawal syndrome. For this reason it's main purpose during withdrawal is an adjunct with other therapies.

To my knowledge Melatonin does not effect the calcium channels that have been disturbed by benzodiazepine usage and this is why, in my view, Melatonin is not very effective on it's own as an Anxiolytic (antianxiety agent.)

My experience is that SSRI's are not very effective for use for withdrawal, however responses to SSRI's are individual dependant.

It is essential to manage benzodiazepine withdrawal and protracted withdrawal syndrome using a variety of methods including CBT, but most effectively, using an alternative Anxiolytic, the most effective of which is Phenibut (CALMEXA).

Phenibut Calmexa is GABA with a phenyl ring that allows it to pass the blood brain barrier, therefore replacing the GABA depleted by benzodiazepine dependence. With medical management it can safely and entirely replace the use of Benzodiazepines, causing an alternative dependence both easier to taper with less risk of protracted withdrawal syndrome. 

Melatonin used together with Phenibut is very effective for inducing sleep, establishing and maintaining a sleeping pattern.

One doc in the er came back after giving pain shot and was shocked I was still awake saying I gave you enough to knock out a horse. He had not seen that high tolerance before.
I was unable to use my cpap correctly because I was tossing and turning in pain or discomfort in finding a comfortable sleep position and waking up because of the apnea.

Trouble falling and staying asleep. Erratic work schedule. I use melatonin infrequently but with extremely high doses (ie used 20mg last night). Result: vivid dreams, but it helps to keep me asleep. Normally I'll sleep for 4 hours, then wake, sometimes can't fall asleep again. Chronic fatigue. I'm reviewing just to let people know that this dosage is safe for me (I feel well rested, still tired but not wired, not irritable). The dreams are to be looked out for, like I said extremely vivid especially the first couple times using melatonin.
The diagnose of fibro should convey to readers that I have experienced chronic physiological (specifically muscular and nervous system) arousal for prolonged periods of time (10-15 years) due to environmental and emotional stress & poor cultural/familial support for stress resolution. Worst instance of emotional stress from 9-22 years old. It has not been fun.

The Melatonin caused me to stay awake all night, oddly, which is the opposite of what it is supposed to do. Usually, I get around a few hours of sleep, early in the morning, because of a combination of Vyvanse and my mother keeping the television on all night. In the morning, when my mother tried to 'wake me up,' which was annoying because she yelled a lot. Today, all day, I felt like I was going to vomit. I have had a lot of head rushes in the past few weeks, which could be because of high blood pressure caused by the Vyvanse, and the head rushes are really bad, from able to be ignored to extreme amounts of pain and almost fainting, but I can live with the head rushes. I feel almost addicted to school, the homework and projects keep me from sitting there and not doing anything, which has gotten me scared about summer. I am intimidated and almost scared about what I will do when I am alone, and not taking drivers ed or going to summer school to learn about high school schedules, because I cannot sleep most nights, I wake up early but am not a morning person, and I feel sick most days when I am not working.

The hallucinations involved watery vision, where everything resembled liquid waves, and complete distortion of light. I've only experienced something similar in my childhood during a shroom trip. As far as I know I'm the only person in my circle to ever experience this melatonin trip effect, and unlike the shrooms it was nonstimulant and basically I thought I was going crazy. 

Upped the dose to 10mg the next night just to test, and it was identical, no more or less crazy.

I take 3mg of melatonin approximately mid-day to advance my sleep phase.  The timing needs to be precise in relationship to my internal body clock, which is not always easy to know.  If I wake after an hour of heavy dream sleep, my waking time is a reliable marker and I will take melatonin eight hours later.  If I hit the right timing window, I'll have fairly strong fatigue within an hour.  This lasts for a couple of hours.  I can't do certain kinds of work in this state, but I can do housework and listen to lectures.  I call it my stupid pill, but it doesn't actually make me stupid, but impairs my ability to generate outward focus.  Missing my window even once can make it hard to recover the required timing accuracy.  The difference is profound.  I can tell I miss the window because I have far less fatigue.  Taking coffee at the same time as the melatonin significantly reduces fatigue, but it also made the treatment less reliable.  Used to have an ""all nighter"" without fail at least once every three weeks for twenty years.  In my first year on melatonin, I lost control only three times and had to flip over.  Variability in the potency messed me up on one of those.  One vendor didn't work at all.  Another vendor works well most of the time, but some bottles aren't all there.  Think I get mild stomach irritation at night, nothing really to complain about, and it could be other things in the pill.  My life is spectacularly better since I discover this, having found the research myself.  Would love to find a 100% consistent formulation.

When I got off of that, I started using this ginseng.  Honestly, this works better than the depo shots for me and that is no exaggeration.  My main problem is motivation...actually getting up and doing something.  It wasn't until I stopped using the ginseng that I realized how motivated I seemed to always be.  I'm not a person who takes medications or natural remedies (low T was the first time I went to a doctor in 6 years), which is why I think I didn't notice a change until I stopped using it.  Less than 2 weeks after stop using it, I had no motivation again.

I've begun using it again, but more sparingly.  This ginseng increased my blood pressure by a lot; I have always had below average blood pressure.  It got the point I couldn't sleep at night only because I could feel my heart pumping and it scared me, so I had to quit taking it.  Now, after a year, I'm going to start using it again but with less dosage.  Be aware...this stuff does work but make sure you keep an eye out for any changes in your body.

That being said, this natural remedy improves my energy levels and motivation quickly and by a lot.  I did notice that morning erections are back in full, also.  I haven't had any problems there, but since I get that effect I would think it may help those with ED problems.

I have used it almost every day for over ten years now. I can't recommend ANYTHING more highly for depression. Trial & error has taught me:
1) SAMe MUST be taken on an empty stomach.
2) ONLY use it in blister packs. (If you buy it in a bottle, it is cheaper, but once the air gets to it, it becomes less and less effective, so by the end, you might just be swallowing an empty pill. Don't chance it.)
3) Shop around to see which brand works best for you.
4) Don't give up. 
5) If you DO give up and quit taking it, step down GRADUALLY or you could become suicidal. This is true of any antidepressant. 
6) Do not use if you are bipolar.
SAMe helped me in so many ways, I can't laud it enough. My RA is gone, as is fibromyalgia, CFIDS, anxiety, and it's also great for jet lag, for some crazy reason I don't understand. I have taken it for ten years, and I know it works, because if I ever run out or forget to take it, I get very depressed again. Good news is, an hour after I take it again, I'm my own real, non-foggy, happy self again! I have also heard it is very helpful for liver function, even among alcoholics, but if YOU are alcoholic, please get help to stop that, too. My dad was an alcoholic. You don't want to do that to your kids or family or friends. Or YOURSELF. You're more valuable than alcohol. ;) ",137

 This kept getting worse. I even went to a doctor to have the nerves checked as I legs started feeling dead and I was afraid of falling. The tests showed some lack of nerve reaction . This kept getting worse until I realized this had all started after taking Sam-e. I quit in Aug of 2015 and now my legs are getting back to normal.

Molly contracted Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia from a penicillin dosage the vet gave to her for a broken toenail; two weeks later, she was at death's door, with a PCV of 15% and in the emergency Vet hospital awaiting a possible Hail Mary transfusion. Fortunately, high dosages of Prednisone and Azathioprine killed her immune system literally hours before death, and her PCV began to rise.

Unfortunately, months of taking the Prednisone and Azathioprine caught up to her, and when she started showing symptoms of being severely ill, we brought her back for more blood work, thinking perhaps the Anemia was beginning to overcome her drug therapy. What the lab results showed was that, while the Anemia had remained in remission, her liver panel was disastrous. Like ""this dog is on the verge of liver failure"" disastrous.

The vet recommended SAM-e and milk thistle, and advised on dosages. It was recommended we bring Molly back in two weeks for a re-check of her liver panel.

Within three days of beginning the SAM-e and Milk Thistle treatment, Molly was beginning to perk up again. She stopped vomiting, stopped having diarrhea, began eating with a normal apetite and was showing signs of playful energy once more. At her two-week vet visit, her liver panel was entirely normal.

The AD's were also no longer performing very well.
Coincidentally (I thought) I was suffering from the symptoms of Fibromialgia....very badly.
Thousands of dollars and 2.5 years of varying fibro treatments ...guess what finally knocked it out.
A big difference was noticable with both depression and fibro in about 5 days!
Fast forward to 2011 ( over 11 years),
I had gone back on prescriptions meds because of insurance not covering SAMe.
I was put on Duloxatine (Cymbalta) about 3 years ago.
The DR. swore there would be no withdrawal effects...just don't take it with anything else.
SO WRONG!!!!
I tried to get off of it for three months (gradually, etc.) with horrible effects. Finally gave up on giving up...until I saw an article about a study on supplementing prescription AD's with SAMe.
If that can be done, then its safe to combine!!
Over the past 5 weeks I have successfully reduced Cymbalta from 60mgs to 15 by gradually subbing it with higher and higher doses of SAMe. No side affects!
Will continue till all the the pharmas are out of my system......and never again for them.

The difference in the arthritis pain level is night and day. I am not nearly as stiff as I used to be and I'm no longer in pain each day. My feet have lost that swollen look and I can wear shoes I haven't been able to wear in a couple of years. It takes care of the depression and I am feeling great. I take 400 mg daily.

That said, in VERY LOW doses(200-400mg) for only a few days during a particularly deep depression, it has helped to alleviate the more severe symptoms without triggering mania, so long as one is responsible enough to stop the treatment after the depression has loosened and not continue to use it until they actually do go into mania.  

In fact, for bipolar patients I would advise against this course unless your doctor approves.  
Even then, do not take it within 2-4 hours of any other psychoactive substance. I myself have had acute serotonemia and it was the single most terrifying, not to mention life-threatening experience of my life. 

My biggest complaint is the price. The least expensive product I have found was $15 at Walmart, but that only includes 36 200mg tablets.  The effective dose range for depression can go as high as 1200-1600mg, so you can see that this is obviously not cost effective.  

However, if many other methods have not worked, or if you are only mildly depressed, this treatment might work well for you.

It relieved my hip pain however, I think it elevated my blood pressure from low/normal/ to high it is also making me feel a lot of strange symptoms like sever burning sensations in my left leg, gas, sleepiness, anxiety, mood swings, headaches, increase in appetite. I went to the doctor yesterday to have me checked for a heart attack and stroke, that's how bad and scared I felt. However, he did not find any reason for concern and I forgot to even tell him about the Sam-E because I thought it irrelevant. it was no until last night that I started thinking that maybe my problem was something new in my diet and realized I had introduced Sam-E. I still didn't think much of that but googled side effect and voila, there it was, most of it anyway. So I am wondering if there are people who have actually died because of Sam-E and thought it was somethings else. Yes, I know I said the word die, but that is how bad I felt.

I understand that Sam-E is produced naturally by your body. If you get an effect from Sam-E, it is because your body does not produce enough of it, so the supplement helps the deficit. 

If you take too much, then the side effects kick in. Over time I have reduced my Sam-E dosage to 200 per day.

She was discharged with a prescription for a proton pump inhibitor, diagnosis: presumed gastritis.  I can't rule out a genetic component here, but also can't rule out a problem with this particular brand/lot.  There may also have been an interaction with Wellbutrin.

I ingest a food or substance (like maltodextrin)
that triggers an inflammatory response.  Also
none of the prescription or over-the-counter pain
meds I have tried have helped with the bone pain.
I found out that I had become calcium-depleted from heavy-metal poisoning from a medical implant.
The intense bone pain has consistently responded to Calcium Supplementation which I take along with Magnesium and now Vitamin D.  These 3 working together have helped decrease the widespread muscle pain I experience part of every day. After
years of depletion and mineral imbalances because 
to the level levels of metal in my body, it is a
daily process to keep the muscle pain away or at least at much lower levels.  I no longer experience the bone pain at all unless I forget
to take these supplements for a few days. The
muscle pain is much trickier to control but I know
from experience that for me dietary restrictions,
Calcium/Magnesium in equal amounts and Vitamin D
especially when I can't get out in the sunshine are essential in controlling the recurring widespread muscle pain/spasms.
Reading others negative experiences with Vitamin D, I know first hand sensitivity response
reactions to foods, medicines, and additives that
others handle well.  But also I notice and have
experienced myself that doctors often prescribe
very large doses for all their patients without
starting them out at a lower dose (which may even
be equally effective) to try to minimize any sensitivity reactions or adverse side effects.
After 6 months on a certain medicine, I asked my doctor if she would increase my dose a little bit.  She ""tripled"" my dosage abruptly without ""titrating"" it upward slowly as recommended. 50,000 IU sounds like a lot

Muscle and Bone Pain
Are Vitamin D Side Effects


This is a side effect of vitamin d that is not so easy to remedy and is actually a sign that you really NEED TO CONTINUE taking the vitamin d. If you experience Pain from Vitamin D this very likely means that your bones have become somewhat demineralized from having vitamin d deficiency for a very long time. When your bones are demineralized and you begin Vitamin D Therapy, this can cause calcium to begin to go back into the bones. When the calcium goes into the bones it drags fluids with it. This fluid can actually cause a small expansion of the 'collagen matrix' inside the bones and this expansion pushes out against the exterior covering of the bone which is very inflexible and has extensive nerve endings. 

When this occurs, you can experience this as bone pain or even muscular pain. If you experience new or worsening pain from taking vitamin d, it is NOT Vitamin D Contraindication, a reason to be scared or to stop taking the vitamin d. If you continue with the Vitamin D Therapy, the pain should subside in several weeks. While uncomfortable, you will be better off in the long run if you manage the pain for this time and 'get through' to the other side.

I have had bone pains and fatigue when initially taking vits/minerals but it went away after a month. I look at it like this - after exercising, the typical feeling is soreness.  Upon consumption of anything, our bodies will experience some sort of physical/emotional/biological feeling because the body is trying to ""purify"" itself.

It is about a year ago, my doctor said my D level is only 10.xx. I still can not handle D supplement in low does after that extreme dry mouth and eyes experience at 2 months ago.

Here is what happened to me in the past 1 year. 

1. No problem when I start took 50,000 iu once a week for few weeks. Its is D3 from fish with doctor's prescription.

2. Over energy when I took it few times a week. So, doctor want me take 2000 iu daily. But, I only took 1000iu two or three times a week. 

3. Maybe dry eye (not dry mouth yet) start when I took 1000iu every other day. I know I have dry eye issue because all new contact lens cause my eye dry. But, this maybe because I am almost 50, so dry eyes is very normal in my age when I wear contact lens. 

4. Check D level again, only 25. So, doctor still wants me to take up to 2000 iu per day.

5. I start experience extreme dry eye and dry mouth after had took 1800 iu or 15000iu per day. By the way, I also start took Calcium with D at that time.

6. Finally, I called doctor, and stop taking any D and Cal supplements. 

7. After stop it for few days, no extreme dry issue anymore, but still feel dry eyes, and still not dare to wear contact lens.

8. After stop a month, I feel much better, but still dry eyes (not extreme). Check D level again, it drop back to 10.50.

9. I try on very low does D once a while, all caused my extreme dry. D 400iu supplement, a cup of milk with D, or a cup of almond milk with D for few days.

Now, I decide stop any food or drink with D supplement at least 3 months. I am not sure what I am going to next.

After my unpleasant D experience, I start vitamin supplement searching, I found a lot of supplement also contains herbs. I also found 1 of my Cal + D supplement does contains a herb which I better keep away.

2451,23,2/18/2012 8:38:32 PM,General Health &amp; Wellness,55-64 Female  (Consumer),5,4,5,"Have been exhausted and depressed for about 6 months. Dr. took blood panel & didn’t even mention my vitamin D score @ 15. When I researched it on my own I asked for the recommended 50,000 iu (D2) once a week for 8 wks. She said “I’ve been a dr. for 30 some years & vitamins are at the bottom rung of things that can be wrong with you.” She advised seeing a psychiatrist.

I gave her the name of Michael Holick MD, a pioneer in vitamin D research who has written a book, & also the site of the National Vitgamin D Council. At 9:00 am the very next day she called in the script. She had no clue about the importance of D or how to assess the numbers from the test. Apparently she did the research I had requested- thank God.

A tip for not having side effects with the high D dosage- take it with a large, fatty meal. It’s a perfect excuse to cheat & have fried foods or lots of butter without guilt. I have had no side effects by doing this (I think I read it on Cleveland Clinic or Dr. Holick’s site). Not through my regimen yet but am feeling brighter with more energy.

Just like educating my Dr., I plan to spread the word to everyone I know about the importance of D deficiency and how it also eventually leads to other serious illnesses. I live in Ohio & heaven knows we don’t get sun for a large part of the year. I am also fair skinned, so slather on the sunscreen in the summer. My body probably could never produce enough D on its own with these circumstances.

One dr. who has done many studies is calling D defiency an epidemic in this country, and unfortunately most doctors haven’t heard anything about it. It’s up to us to educate them!

I wish you all well, Ceci

After reading all your posts some people need to do a bit more research on Vitamin D dosage. There are 2 types of Vitamin D in the body. Vitamin D2 is created by the body and then gets transformed to Vitamin D3. Thi 50,000 IU of Vitamin D is Vitamin D2. This creates a high level of Vitamin D2 but gets slowly converted to D3. Vitamin D3 is what the body uses and no Doctor would ever give someone 50,000 IU of Vitamin D3. It takes months of a high level of Vitamin D3 intake to create toxic levels. So rest assured the 50,000 IU of Vitamin D2 is safe. I am being treated with 50,000 IU because I have had muscle spasm and bone pain for 8 years after I was finally diagnosed with Vitamin D Deficiency (20) I have to take it once a week and have only been doing so for 1 weeek. I did notice some severe muscle twitching, but it was in the areas that I have severe muscle spasm (trigger points). Twitching to me indicates that the D is working because the muscles are reacting to something foreign to them. Also, with any treatment, one should always give the treatment at least a month before discontinuing. We must remember that our bodies are lacking something that it needs and when our bodies get ""used"" to not having this, it will react as if it is a foreign substance and eventually our bodies will get used to the higher amount. I only gave three stars because I have just started the treatement. I will update after the treatment has completed.",193

My calcium level
is 10.1 and now they believe it could be primary, not secondary. My Gastro doc. thinks primary and my endocrinologist says maybe, he isn't positive. The other side to all of this is that I also have untreated sleep apnea I stop breathing 39 times per hour. I endocrinologist says that if my boby suddenly begins to retain the vit D that we are in for some real trouble so he watches me very close. I have to have labs done every 6 weeks. I have had 4 vertebrae
fused together and facing another surgery.
Anyway, my point is this I have been on RX strength for three years and haven't felt any benefit, but, when I don't take it my
parathyroid hormone levels go way up causing more bone loss. I have been tested
for malasorption and everything else.

I bought the petite Caltrate Citrate + D3 calcium (can be taken with or without food) and a high potency Vit D3 1000 mg per pill. I have been afraid to take the extra calcium and Vit D until I am done with the 50,000 mg. It just seems to be a large amount.  I go to an endocrinologist, and she faithfully tests my Vit D levels. When I first went to her she tested my thyroid because I was exhausted all the time and have body pains. My thyroid was l-o-w and am now on a 50 mg pill a day for that. I have hypothyroid (according to others I've talked to, this is not unusual as you get older). Due to this, my doctor started testing my calcium and Vit D. I can remember my mom telling me that I had rickets when I was a baby and would not walk. I do not know what the treatment was at that time, but I do know she took me to the doctor. My doctor was not surprised to hear this news since I have low calcium and Vit D. My energy level increased due to the thyroid treatment. I am hoping when this calcium and Vit D gets to working, my body will be pain free. I have never had any problems taking the high dose of 50,000 mg and faithfully take it once a week until it will be gone (I have great faith in my doctor). Then I will faithfully take the others daily and be retested again. I even double checked with the office girl about this and she called me back and said I was to take the daily supplements in between the 50,000 doses. I still think I know my body and am waiting until I take the last large dose before taking the dailies.  Hope this helps!",2

I tell everyone I talk to about how important Vitamin D is....and I will continue to do so...I am living proof that Vitamin D is important....I have now seen liquid Vitamin D...so if you are having problems taking the soft gel...perhaps try the liquid D....and as with every thing else....this takes time and effort so that you can ""feel"" a difference....

Have been taking Rx for 18 years and it DID save my life. Got better, but still never really felt 100% at any time over the years.

I read about Vit D3 deficiency (http://www.vitamindcouncil.org) and got tested (using the correct test (25-hydroxyvitamin D test, also called a 25(OH)D ) . I was woefully deficient (28). Need to be in the 50-80 range, so started with the 2,000 IU/day and then found the 5,000 IU pill at iHerb.com (FYI: use DAH122 for $5.00 off your first order - my gift to you, :)  ) 

Since taking the Vit D3, my mood has dramatically improved - to the point that I am NOT taking any pharmaceutical Rx for depression for the first time in 18 years! I am truly amazed. Also, my overall health is better, my 'bad' cholesterol levels are dropping, no colds - not even the sniffles - since taking Vit D3. I've LOST approx. 25 pounds (read this may be due to NOT TAKING the anti-depressant). 

I will continue to take Vit D3 until I die. Absolutely remarkable results! Living in MN coupled with Scandinavian heritage, this vitamin is a MUST. I would recommend you get your Vit D3 levels checked.. and remember, if the lab you Dr. uses is Quest, then you have to multiply your results by 1.3 to get a more accurate result. Quest Labs have 'issues' and  yes, you can Google it for yourself. And don't listen to those that say a range of 30-40 is 'normal' and 'fine'. READ the results of the clinical RESEARCH, even if it is lengthy and technical.. Please don't be swayed by the pharmaceutical companies (and the FDA's)disinformation.  Take charge of YOUR life and do the research! You'll be glad you did.

The brand I use is not listed (Healthy Origins), so I just picked one.

Problems included: severe fatigue, muscle pain, severe joint swelling and pain, bone pain, ""foggy"" feeling, sinus problems, ear problems, a positive ANA test result and breathing problems.  I've tried multiple treatments through several doctors and specialists.  Switched to a new doctor and - during intake - found low Vitamin D levels.  Doctor prescribed 100,000 IU's to be taken one time each week for four weeks (to be retested following).  Initially, I experienced an increase in pain, almost like a tenderness all over my body.  However, the joint swelling, pain, sinus, and several other problems have subsided and the tenderness is getting better.  It wasn't overnight, but I am getting better.

I would highly recommend this treatment.  I know some of the prescribed levels sound scary, but it has helped me to finally experience relief after 10 years of pain...and the level I am taking is short term.  Please stay at it as best you can, I experienced relief from my symptoms and I believe that you can as well, but you'll need to stick with it.

The only reason I rated the ""Effectiveness"" section with 2 stars was due to the fact that I haven't completed treatment yet. I haven't noticed any changes with my symptoms, but I'm not sure if my symptoms are due to the D deficiency and I'm only half way through the prescription I was given.  I know many people are hesitant to take 50,000iu (as I was and to be truthful it still gives me pause every time I take it) and I wanted to share my experience with others who are deficient. 

From all the research I have gathered over the last several weeks of reading up on the subject of D deficiency - this is something people shouldn't take lightly.  The medical community have finally realized that D deficiency leads to a whole host of medical problems.  Vitamin D can not only provide treatment for some conditions, but actually prevent others from occurring in the first place.  I couldn't deny the facts and knew I had to take this or possibly deal with greater problems in the future as a result of depriving my body of something it vitally needs.  

One other point I wanted to mention for others who might be going through the same experience I am and that's Vitamin D deficiency and an underactive thyroid.  The information on a possible connection  between the two conditions on medical sites have been sketchy - it's alluded to in some writings, but nothing concrete is documented.  Maybe it's wishful thinking on my part that the D deficiency is the cause for the thyroid problem, but only time will tell.  My thyroid is a little underactive, but yet my thyroid antibodies test is negative for hypothyroidism.  So, again, maybe there isn't a link between the two conditions. 

I will give another update if anything new happens, if not, I will give a final entry at the end of October when I go for another set of blood tests to see if the D has increased my numbers.",65

My doctor prescribed 50000iu of D2 once a week for 7-8 weeks and then I will be retested.  Like many I was very hesitant, but I finally took the first dose 5 days ago with no problems.  I had a little bit of nausea after 10 hrs., but this is something I have had before and can't really say it was due to the Vitamin D.  I took some Maalox Total and was fine shortly thereafter.  I will update my progress for others that may be hesitant to take this dosage around the middle to late September.  I will share my experience with this dosage over those 7-8 weeks and my lab results to see how much my number increases.  

I finally decided to take the vitamin D because I have been suffering for the last 2 1/2 years with joint soreness, fatigue and just a general feeling of having the flu.  Blood tests were not showing anything conclusive and my new doctor ran the D test after I told her a rheumatologist I went to never ran the test.  Is this the cause of my symptoms? I won't know until I am done with the D therapy, but again I will update later next month in case there is anyone else that may be having similar symptoms.  ",41

I think your doctor wants you to either take the 50,000 units weekly or the 400 units, daily.  You don't have to take both.  Start with the prescribed dose. You are usually only prescribed for a short time period.  If it's too much, or you don't feel good on it, cut back to the 400 units daily.  I am increasing my dose to 800 units slowly.  It has a nice side effect of lifting my mood.  Buy a good brand of over the counter D3.  Make sure your get the D3 and the other forms of D are synthetic. Susan",36

I'm still skeptical about it since I have been working on endurance, so it's hard to say if it was because of the supplement or because I'm physically improving my condition with exercise and a healthy lifestyle.  This was, however, the ONLY change I've made in recent weeks.  I'll continue taking it for now.",47

When I got off of that, I started using this ginseng.  Honestly, this works better than the depo shots for me and that is no exaggeration.  My main problem is motivation...actually getting up and doing something.  It wasn't until I stopped using the ginseng that I realized how motivated I seemed to always be.  I'm not a person who takes medications or natural remedies (low T was the first time I went to a doctor in 6 years), which is why I think I didn't notice a change until I stopped using it.  Less than 2 weeks after stop using it, I had no motivation again.

I've begun using it again, but more sparingly.  This ginseng increased my blood pressure by a lot; I have always had below average blood pressure.  It got the point I couldn't sleep at night only because I could feel my heart pumping and it scared me, so I had to quit taking it.  Now, after a year, I'm going to start using it again but with less dosage.  Be aware...this stuff does work but make sure you keep an eye out for any changes in your body.

That being said, this natural remedy improves my energy levels and motivation quickly and by a lot.  I did notice that morning erections are back in full, also.  I haven't had any problems there, but since I get that effect I would think it may help those with ED problems.

I had taken 2 on December 6th, and got terribly sick.  Intense vomiting, weakness and body aches.  At that time I chocked it up to a stomach flue bug.  In the back of my mind I kind of thought that the Ashwagandha had something to do with it that day, so I hadn't taken anymore.  This past Monday was my day off so I thought I would give it another try, this time I took 1 table.  In two hours I was vomiting intensely again, basically in the same manner I did on December 6th.  I couldn't function for the next 4 hours.  I continued to vomit and feel very poor the rest of the day.  And today, two days later, i'm still not feeling 100 percent.   
So, I did some checking and according to the information I found, it can effect those who take Thyroid medications.  When I was a kid I had graves disease and had my Thyroid completely removed and I take the medication Synthyroid for that condition.   I'm guessing that that has something to do with the reaction I had???

We also changed her diet.  We've cut out gluten - wheat, rice, barley, rye and Oats.  We also cut out all plants of the deadly night shade variety - tomatoes, eggplant, peppers and potatoes.  

She excercises everday on a treadmill for 20 minutes at a slow speed.

When I stopped for a few weeks her age-related and

very impaired making it difficult to communicate

and she can stand up for 5 minutes, walk across the room and even play Scrabble with me.  Without
the CoQ 10 it had become so difficult to take care
of her at home over a 6-8 week period that I thought I would have to put her in a Care Home. 
I read that Lovastatin causes CoQ 10 deplepletion

I am a 60 year old female, and I have been taking co-Q-10 supplements daily for over 20 years.  I began taking it after reading a research paper that indicated that co-Q-10 might be effective in increasing immune response.  My whole life prior to that time, I was extremely susceptible to infections; if someone with the flu or a cold even looked at me across a room, I got sick.  I was constantly sick as a child, and as an adult suffered what seemed like a continuous cold throughout the winter, along with episodes of the flu, bronchitis, etc.  NOTHING helped, not dietary intervention, not the then-popular vitamin C dosage, nothing.  After several months of taking a combined dose of co-Q-10, vitamin E and lecithin (a cocktail suggested in the research paper), I noticed that I was not getting sick as often.  I have continued the same dosage since that time, and I have not had a single cold while taking it.  No colds, no flu, no bronchitis, nothing. I did suspend the dosage for several weeks two or three times, to see if it made a difference.  It did.  Caught a cold.  Started dosage again and returned to cold-free status. (I should note that after reading reports earlier this year that long-term dosage with vitamin E could be harmful, I discontinued the vitamin E portion of the cocktail.  I have not noticed any decrease in effectiveness).   So I am curious to know if there have been any further studies on this effect of co-Q-10.  Is it possible that this could be a placebo effect of such lasting duration?  What say you, experts?  Inquiring minds want to know. ^_^

3388,34,9/11/2009 2:17:02 PM,Statin-induced myopathy,"BabyBoomer, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Consumer)",5,4,5,I have been taking Ubiguinol(Kaneka QH)for my muscle weakness and pain. This specific type of Ubiguinol has relieved all my symptoms. I started at 50mg with no change then to 100mgs with significate relief. I believe the initial problem started because of a statin drug I was taking and I assumed if I stopped taking the statin the muscle pain and weakness would stop but it didn't. As this was unusal I researched looking for anything I could do to relieve the muscle problem and Ubiquinol(Kaneka QH) worked. I since have talked to my doctor and was recommended I increase the dose to 200mgs as I am going to try another statin drug for my high cholesterol. I am also having additional testing for any other condition that may have caused the muscle pain and weakness after stopping the statin. I hope this information might help someone else considering Ubiquinol (Kaneka QH). Do the reshearch for yourself.   ,39

The guarana is best when it is not used for more than 24 hours and there is at least 24 hours or more before the next dose. Using it in that manner helps to avoid the caffeine withdrawal migraine type of headache that occurs when I used it for several days in a row and then would miss a day in the same manner as would happen when habitually drinking coffee and then skipping a day.",80
