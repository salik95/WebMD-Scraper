On the days that I took it, only 125mg a day, carnitine soon made me feel very unpleasantly hyper (like ""speed""), so badly that I craved a drink to calm my nerves (I was a totally recovered alcoholic until that point). I have lost weight (30 lbs in a year), but I think my paleo diet was the major factor - prob. already getting plenty of carnitine from all the meat I eat - so supplementing was actually too much of it. L-carnitine did not improve my muscle aches/pains - in fact, I often felt an ""acid-like burning"" while taking it.

Might be too early, but I can safely say that I am no longer a victim of my own depressive thoughts.  I am no longer a person who is constantly sad and angry. The only flip side is that 5-HTP does wreak some havoc in my stomach and I feel bloated with gas at times. But it does seem to feel less intense as the days go and I am hoping that my gut will get used to this supplement. 
Overall, what a miracle supplement. My only regret is that why didn't anyone informed me about 5-HTP earlier. I feel as if so many decades of my life wasted on being weary all the time and so many days and opportunities to seek happiness were missed. Nonetheless, better late than never.

I experienced results within three days of taking 50mg once a day in the AM. It works for me, YMMV. The mood effect is subtle but consistent. My mood feels more stable, particularly more resilient. I have fewer anxiety spikes.

I didn't take it for sleep disturbance, but it has improved the quality of sleep significantly. I wake up much earlier and without grogginess when I've taken it the day before. I also have dreams that I remember. Part of the stress resilience I feel may come from the effects the 5-HTP has had on my sleep.

It's probably not a plug-and-play supplement that can safely be taken on its own. Do your research. I take l-tyrosine with it (to prevent dopamine depletion/imbalance). The recommended ratio is 10:1, but my body seems to do better with 5:1. Because 5-HTP can cause heart valve damage via increased peripheral serotonin, I take EGCG (which effectively neutralizes the peripheral serotonin that doesn't make it past the BBB) and omega-3 (to increase bio-availability of the EGCG).",5

I used 5-HTP a few times before but it was never when I was really depressed so all it did was give me a calmer feeling and slight contentment. This week I started using 5-HTP again, with doses averaging 300-500mg a day. By the very first few days I have already noticed an increased mood, and more positive thinking. I had already begun a change in my mentality before the 5-HTP that was pulling me out of my depression but the 5-HTP just catapulted me straight upwards and I feel that it is speeding the process. Somedays I just look around me and am in this feeling of wonder and aliveness. It's like that feeling of life has been handed back to me. It's very meditative. I would recommend this BUT I am worried about heart valve issues if used for a long-term time, so I will be weaning off of this slowly now as I believe I have already gained what I wanted from it.

I feel it's my duty to let everybody know that 5-htp actually works. I'll be honest with you and admit that I've been experimenting with MDMA, which on some occasion brought me lows (depression) for a few days after consuming it. Hearing it can help manage those symptoms, I decided to buy it. (It's really a harm reduction strategy and not an encouragment do to MDMA!)

Since buying 5-HTP, I've taken it twice, and NOT after MDMA but while completely sober and feeling fine, and unexpectedly it made me a whole lot more content and healed some low level anxieties. It actually made me feel good and not crave any kind of drug to make me more happy (i.e. alcohol, tobbaco, MDMA). It's not that I'm an addict by any means, but I often have this desire to get f****d up for no good reason really. It also made me sleep a whole lot better, without waking up during the night, and the dreams were crazy vivid and life-like but I liked it, it's interesting. Oh yeah, and there were some ""side effects"": sleepines, perhaps not feeling mentally as sharp, feeling a bit mellowed out. Well, it's not that any of these are bad by themselves, but they can sort of have an effect on your productivity. Taking it before bad is probably the wisest, so you sleep it over. :)

I forgot to mention: The first time I took 200 mg and I think it was a bit too much. I was feeling very balanced and in good mood, but overpowered by side effects. Second time it was 50 mg before sleep.

I'm not saying I'll start to use it regularly, but I can see it's potential for reducing depression and anxiety. It's legal and it really does have an effect which is definietly not placebo. I personally could probably reccomend it even for just having fun or relaxing. Why not take 100 or 200mg and chill out with friends? It does have some slightly euphoric effects. IMO far better and helthier than drinking booze or doing some drugs to achieve that feeling or get rid of anxieties. Just a thought!

Wish you the best :)",8

Feelings of love, from loving what you're doing, to feeling better about people around you. Similar feeling to MDMA. I don't know why, it might just be my experience, but the effects seriously last 3 days or so. Then for about 3-4 more days just a general content feeling. After about a week you're back at baseline but I swear that's better than before when I never took any anti-depressants. 

BTW, messing with serotonin is dangerous, why I've never sought to get prescribed SSRIs or anything. That's why I only take 1 100mg pill every few days, it only takes a small amount to change the balance of serotonin in your brain. It takes other chemicals in your brain to work....so too much, and you might not even feel the desired effects, just the bad side effects. 100mg/day to me would be crazy. Side effects include a stiff jaw/temples, headaches, stomachache, vomiting, and can last as long it takes for your body to clear all the serotonin.

That one little pill a day has caused me to completely turn my mood around into something so positive so that I could go about my day with productivity again. I can also note that my sleep schedule and problems with insomnia have completely dissolved allowing me to have peaceful yet deep slumber every single night. I go to sleep and wake up in the same spot! I wake up feeling ready to start the day instead of wishing I had a few more hours to sleep. A side effect to take into consideration before trying out 5HTP is increased dreaming. It caused my first full blown lucid dream and has made my dreams more lucid and intense. To me it was a good side effect but it may be bothersome for others. Overall, I will continue to take one a day and see how far this goes. ",118

i also suffer from terrible pms( worsened due to hormone imbalance caused by endometriosis and ovarian cysts): whole spectrum of moodswings.I would yell at people,unable to stop myself,after i have yelled at them,i would sit and cry,because it feels awful to know why it happened,but that i wasnt able to stop myself,i would end up selfloathing and hating myself.

Haven't had any suicidal thoughts but its still too early to tell if it's working. Also I'm having a hard time going to sleep and staying asleep these last 3 days- often times having to stay in the living room to avoid tossing and turning and waking my bf up. Hopefully 5htp is the answer for those extreme mood patterns without having to go on ant-depressants with crazy side effects- I am going to give it two weeks to really see if there is a result. On top of that I eat pretty healthy and seek spiritual help- (although clearly this is not enough- I feel I really do have a serotonin level that needs to be adjusted) Also I really hope this insomnia goes away after my body gets more used to taking 5htp- I'm going to start taking it in the late afternoon instead of night to see if that will help.

I am extremely aware that everyone reacts differently to different chemicals, but for me, it has been a godsend. I take 2 x 100 casuals at night, and from day 3 onward, I have literally never felt better.
 I sleep, have lovely calm dreams (as apposed to constant nightmares), wake up energised & I am happy & completely at peace. 
I have suddenly & completely gone off sugar, and although I am not overweight, I have lost 3 kilos in 2 weeks. 
This would actually be my only warning; if you are someone who struggles to gain & retain weight, I would be careful on 5-htp & force yourself to eat, even if you don't want to. 
Other than that, I have had a 100% positive experience with no side effects whatsoever, & I would encourage anyone who has depression to give this supplement a chance.

I started it after my boyfriend died unexpectedly and I fell into a severe depression (normally I suffer from mild depression). I didn’t have insurance, and started researching alternatives to SSRIs. I had taken Zoloft for a spell years ago and it worked for me okay (though I didn’t like the side effects). The day I started taking it it worked! I was able to get out of bed and do the dishes, a major accomplishment at that time in my life. Over time and with an increased dosage, my depression and anxiety lifted and my concentration and focus improved. It also helped my sleep, and I didn’t experience a decreased libido like I did on Zoloft.

My advice:

1) Work with your doctor if you want to try this. Do not take 5-HTP with other meds unless instructed by your doctor as this can cause bad interactions (e.g., see #3 -serotonin syndrome).

2) Start with a low dose and work your way up. I started with 50 mg. Over time I upped it by 50 mg increments until I found what worked for me (150 mg once a day). 

3) Serotonin Syndrome (where getting too much serotonin is toxic) is real, but from what I have read you have to take 300 mg or more before you see toxic effects. This information may change over time as research teases this out, and I suspect it differs depending on the person. 

4) Take an enterically-coated version of 5-HTP. This means it breaks down in the intestine and not the stomach. After a year or so of taking uncoated pills, I started to experience stomach rumbling and discomfort, and a low-grade fever. The enteric pills eliminated this issue. 

5) Get a good quality product to ensure you are getting a pure product. I take Solaray. 

6) If it makes you sleepy, take it at night. I initially tried it on a Saturday day, when I knew I’d have the day off and could see how it made me feel. It made me drowsy. I now take it ~45 minutes before bed and that’s worked well for me.",171

WARNING if you are prone to bi-polar or manic phases then very carefully watch yourself and get a good friend to keep an eye on you.

Initially, some nausea and headaches and fatigue, as well as difficulty staying asleep through the night.

Because I'm still having some mild panic sometimes during the night, I'm going to gradually increase the dose - taking 50 mg in the morning and 50 mg at night.

It did lift my mood and suppress my appetite but the side effects were not worth the benefits of taking it. 2 days after taking 1 pill per day in the morning I woke up and felt my face twitching. It was more than just twitching, I thought my face muscle was going to pop put of my skin. My face was twitching on the left side below my eye. This continued off and on during the day. I kept taking the 5-HTP in hopes that this was just a fluke and was not related to taking it, although 5-HTP was the only thing I was taking prescription and non prescription.The twitching just became worse and my muscles became very sore primarily in my arms.This twitching would move from one area of my face to another. I had no idea when it would happen and it was scary. I stopped taking the 5-HTP and all of these symptoms stopped. I really wanted to be able to take this because I felt so much better and I believe my family noticed the improvement in mood. My dose was 50 mg per day. I may try it again one dose 1- 2 times a week instead of every day. So far I haven't tried it again. I'm really surprised more people haven't commented on the negative side effects of this.

If you are experiencing anxiety, mind racing, etc after being on 5-htp, this is often the symptoms of serotonin syndrome. It means you do not need that much.  Some of these doses are crazy.  You should also drink green tea eith your 5-htp to protect your arteries (theoretical side effect).  A side BENEFIT of green tea is that it has theanine which will increase other brain chemicals that might be low.  I suffer from moderate to severe depression at times, and can only 50 mg for about 3-4 days before I start suffering from anxiety.  Then I'm good for weeks.  Take your 5-htp...not too much...for whatever amt of days. As soon as you start getting s/e's, this is your threshold. Do not take again till the benefits wear off.  You'll have to play around with this.  I suspect some people may be more sensitive due to various reasons. Maybe even methylation problems.  Also remember serotonin ain't the only kid on the block.

WATCH YOUR DOSAGE!!!   I cut a 100 mg tab into quarters and take only 1 daily, with very rare taking 2, so that is only 25mg daily normally.    Great treatment, but the dosage may be what causes so many of the problems people describe.   Who ever said that 100mg was a 'correct' dosage so that so many people take it as a minimum??!!??    And taking multiple dosages, or multiple times daily....talk about too much of a good thing!!!   Get a pill cutter, or split your capsules.  

I can feel the impact of the treatment within 10-20 min, calming my anxiety.    I usually take around noon.   Have GAD and have had panic attacks.    Xanax was horrible.  Dropped it quickly....thank God.   Since starting this 5htp treatment, and taking some GABA only at bedtime which I added to the mix about a year ago, no panic attacks at all.  Anxiety, but no panic.    

I do take 10-15mg amitryp at bedtime, which is a VERY SMALL dose, not therapuetic accoridng to Doc, but am very careful still with 5htp and the ami.    Never taken together at same time or too close together.   

I would recommend 5htp without reservation for anxiety, but at a smaller, more controlled, dosage.   ",42

Because of its chemical and biochemical relationship to L-Tryptophan, 5-HTP has been under vigilance by consumers, industry, academia and government for its safety. However, no definitive cases of toxicity have emerged despite the worldwide usage for the last 20 years.

I noticed the results within 15 minutes! I felt a calm that I have not known for YEARS!

It acted like a stimulant for me and I even had trouble sleeping the first few weeks.

I did experience headaches at first but they have now gone away. This did concern me an I would like to know more about the cause.
I also ate less at first, but I now seem to be normalized. It wasn't like being on Ritalin or Adderall where you feel shaky and  the idea of food is repulsive. It's very subtle and you only eat when hungry without overdoing it.

There was a scare about 5HTP in 1988 due to a contaminated batch from Japan, coming from the labs of Showa Denko caused 37 deaths and 1500 permanent disablements. 
Controversy at the time between big pharmas, the biotech and FDA resulted in a blanket ban of 5HTP. Pharmas would rather sell you the more expensive SSRI's. Biotech don't want you to know it was Genetic Engineering caused the problem. FDA played safe and banned everything just in case, or maybe under direction from lobbying by big P & BT.
User consensus says 5-HTP is very helpful, and videos on youtube from qualified professionals saying so. 
Me? I found it immensely helpful and get mine from a reputable source. 
If I hear that ""voice of depression"" I take 2 x 50mg tablets of 5 hydroxy tryptophan in the evening, it gives me a great night's sleep, possibly because it also converts to melatonin and significantly elevates my mood in the morning, presumably due to increased serotonin levels. 
I wish WebMD would update their statement to ""avoid"" this very helpful food supplement, and stop misleading people who need help, but they have not responded to my attempts to contact them with links about the original 5HTP contamination. 
Don't cross medicate with SSRI's or MAOI's and it is probably perfectly safe.

A lot of nights I couldn't get to sleep until 4 or 5 in the morning and then I could hardly function all day. I also would wake up about every 90 mins usually after having very unsettling and vivid dreams. I started taking a sleep aid that contains 10mg of 5-htp and what a difference! the very first night I went to sleep easily without tossing and turning for hours as I usually did. I have been sleeping through the night and rarely have to get up. My dreams are not upsetting anymore and I feel very well in the morning. This very tiny dose works for me and has made a big difference. I tried taking a sleep aid that didn't contain 5-htp to see if it made a difference and after one night I went back to taking the aid with the 5-htp because the 5-htp does make a difference.

I had been reading about 5-HTP and seeing the results from comments such as below have been having on peoples lives so decided to try for myself.. what did I have to lose right.. ? My MD had scribed Xanax for me... but it was really causing me to detach from life altogether.. 

I was at Costo last week and found Natrol 5-HTP - although dubious yet excited.. I tried the product and have been taking it for a week.. 

Well I honestly have to say.. WOW.. what a difference... No more Mr Snapper Head and now I am feeling like ""normal"".. I have no idea how it performs on appetite control as I am a foodie.. but I can say without a doubt that my mood has lifted and I am out of my funk and thats after 1 week.. I have found that the stupid small stuff in life that would occupy my mind for no reason at all has pretty much gone.. I have started to accept things for what they are and move on.. instead of dwelling and festering on things.. 
So - my opinion - for what it is worth.. go to Costco or the drug store - try it for yourself.. I think you will see a difference.. as so many people like myself have.

I am heading on a family reunion vacation in a week.. my Sister said.. ""bring your Xanax"" - lol - nope - ""ill bring my 5-htp !""",239

With a terminal parent, a new baby and a full time job . . . I never had an oppurtunity to deal with all the emotions and eventually, it hit me like a ton of bricks. 

I didn't even know there was a problem until I had a severe panic attack and ended up in the emergency room. I was put on antidepressents (Lexapro originally and Zoloft after) both of which gave me severe panic attacks and anxiety 24 hours a day. I went from functioning to nonfunctioning almost immediately. I began not being able to sleep and having severe migraine headaches. 

I have begun taking 50 mg of 5-htp every other night along with a multi vitamin and fish oil daily. Of course, I have also done behavioral cognitive therapy and have seen a social worker but I have noticed an amazing difference in my depression and my anxiety has almost completely lifted. I am sleeping again. I feel like myself again only better. I am happy and I truly think it was all of these things put together but 5-htp had alot to do with it.  

I will say that I am 24 years old and am 5'3, 120 lbs. The first afternoon I took 100 mg and it was way too much for me. But the side effects were still not as bad as the antidepressents. I do currently still get headaches almost everyday; however, the duration and severity has improved. Hopefully at some point, these will go away too!

Mild depression and anxiety I have had for many years and this along with a reduction of refined sugars and more quality protein and lots of veggies has changed my life. I have had no side effects from this brand.It should also be taken with B6 for better absorption and this brand has the B6 in with the 5HTP.

Am taking ashwagandha and shatavar powder mix with mildly warm water or milk just before sleep. I can guarantee you your sleep will be better by 50 -100 percent but a little patience is needed. A month is enough to see visible results. I used to sweat it in evening exercises, run a lot even meditate but nothing has helped like ashwagandha. The pain of sleepless nights is unspeakable. I have been through it for 10 years now but something finally is helping me so posting my review.

I had taken 2 on December 6th, and got terribly sick.  Intense vomiting, weakness and body aches.  At that time I chocked it up to a stomach flue bug.  In the back of my mind I kind of thought that the Ashwagandha had something to do with it that day, so I hadn't taken anymore.  This past Monday was my day off so I thought I would give it another try, this time I took 1 table.  In two hours I was vomiting intensely again, basically in the same manner I did on December 6th.  I couldn't function for the next 4 hours.  I continued to vomit and feel very poor the rest of the day.  And today, two days later, i'm still not feeling 100 percent.   
So, I did some checking and according to the information I found, it can effect those who take Thyroid medications.  When I was a kid I had graves disease and had my Thyroid completely removed and I take the medication Synthyroid for that condition.   I'm guessing that that has something to do with the reaction I had???

While Echinacea and Licorice intake can be repeated up to 3 times in 24 hours, Vitamin C should be limited only to once a day, and no more than 6 consecutive days, lest you should increase the chance of kidney stone syndrome. When you combine E and L only, you bet 17~26% boost from each compared to taking it alone in boosting your immunological capacity. In my experiences, taking them while my stomach is empty would make them work faster. This formula works even for virus-driven ailments such as flu, which defies most medications, because you are boosting your immunological defense mechanism. Although not experimented, post chemotherapy cancer patients should also benefit greatly in combating pneumonia, as chemotherapy destroys one's natural immunological defense mechanism in nearly all the cases, wherein you robbed Peter to pay Paul.

Last year, it was so bad that it went deeper than the skin and ate into my flesh in one spot...leaving a scar that's still there today. This year, it itches very little, the rash isn't very raised, and as I said, absolutely no blisters.

My experience has been first hand. Herbs dosages are critically important for some herbs. Ginkgo like yohimbe and ginseng is very concentrated and has powerful effects most commonly than not. We are far too reckless with these. I wouldn't experiment with Ginkgo unless a last resort is very necessary. Its your brain after all. Use a detox instead for your brain. Adrenals and hormone levels have been my first concern for aging fatigue, hair loss and male sexual function. For me Ginkgo is no good at all and difficult to be free of the side effects. Worse than chromium picolinate and may last years longer. If you have anxiety, stress or a mental issue such as depression seek a herbal holistic medical doctor instead of a maven or family practitioner",15

I chose not to have a pacemaker and I quit going to that Cardiologist.  I then read about Hawthorn Berry (Nature's Way Brand: Standardized Hawthorn) and on my own I began taking 2 capsules once to twice a day.  After a year's time on this regimen, I contacted a new Cardiologist and he ran tests which indicated that although I had some heart damage from the earlier heart attack, I no longer had congestive heart failure.  Thus no need for the congestive heart failure medication.  Boy was I happy about that!!  Regarding Hawthorn's other benefits -- well, I can't tell whether Hawthorn Berry has helped me in cholesterol and blood pressure readings because I am still taking medications for those things.  Perhaps the Hawthorn supplementation helps support those other medications, but I still found them necessary.  Nevertheless I am very grateful to a kind Father in Heaven who guided me through prayer to find this beneficial herb that he has placed on this beautiful earth so that my health prognosis as a 60 year old man is very good with good performance in my treadmills and other tests.

Holy Basil is the first herb I have come across that helps reduce the sensation of tightness or heaviness in the chest caused by asthma, without the stimulant effect typical of asthma medications (Holy Basil works similarly to Mucinex.)

Holy Basil also reduces stress, which can help promote sleep without feeling groggy or doped up. In fact, I find Holy Basil most useful against AM insomnia (waking too early with inability to get back to sleep). 

I began taking Holy Basil, initially, as an alternative to NSAIDS because it seems to help relieve muscular pain to some extent.

I find Holy Basil works best in standardized capsule form on an empty stomach. When taking more than one capsule per day, it is possible to become hypoglycemic (for those who are prone, like me, to reactive hypoglycemia).

My most surprising experience with Holy Basil came recently when I ate something that disagreed with me at dinner.

I was also using Flonaise and Symbicort everyday since February.  I was also almost constantly taking Halls cough drops.  Coughing and congestion also kept me from sleeping at night. All the medication also made my mouth very dry. 

I got on the internet to find anything that might help and decided to get holy basil capsules (by Himalaya), astragalus capsules, snd Yin-chiao Immune Drops.  I got all three on April 11th and started taking them right away.  I felt much better with my congestion after only two days.  Mucus came out easily.  I immediately totally stopped using all the other medication.   

It's been six days from when I started with Holy Basil, Astragalus, and Yin-chiao, and I have been feeling wonderful.  I still have allergy but no heavy chest congestion or severe coughing.

The problem is that 3 years ago I was diagnosed with transverse myelitis and have a rather large m.s. type lesion on my spinal cord.  It was an awful and very scary experience which caused some residual nerve damage. My neurologist has been watching me closely as sometimes T.M. is the first attack of M.S.. I have had generally good health in the last 3 years and have had no new lesions.  The problem is that every time I go back on inositol, which I am motivated to do because it relieves my ocd, I have steadily worsening residual effects from my intitial attack of T.M.. I have recently been taking it for about 3 months and had to stop as my legs became weaker and weaker and my balance worse and worse.  It took me about 2 years after my T.M. attack to get full strength back in my legs and to not feel and look like I  was drunk when I walked. After this recent period of taking inositol again all my walking problems were steadily coming back.  I had to stop. Two days later I feel 100 percent better.  There is absolutely no doubt to me that the inositol is causing this. When I looked this up on line to see if there is anything written to help me understand why this is occuring I did find a small bit of info saying something about how people with m.s. shouldn't take inositol because it increases killer t cells aand that is not good if you have m.s..

It was extremely easy for him to take since it is tasteless and the product I ordered on Amazon dissolved completely in liguid.  After one dose of 600 milligrams I saw a difference and so did he.  After two, he started to say how it made him feel better.  After three (the next day) he said ""Mom, I think this is how God had wanted me to be."" which said it all!!! This has only been our third day so I am careful to say we have to see, however, his behavior explains it all.  Situations which would have surely ended up in a tantrum now can be discussed and dismissed.  He is still upset by things (doesn't like the smell of canned dog food, doesn't like leggos moved, etc) but he now has ""power"" over his decisions on how to handle the matter.  Sigh...

The symptoms have varied over time as I have gotten older and went from the actions and tics to a manifestation of problematic thoughts with a few lingering tics. This has been troubling to myself and my family, to the point of no end.  We were at our wits end and explored the conventional treatment, of course I don't feel the benefits out weigh the side-effects of those drugs and decided to stick to my more natural path as I do with all my remedies. I tried Inositol as a last resort and said my prayers. My prayers were answered to say the least. I experimented with the dosage, but ultimately decided that 6mg in 2mg doses, three times daily worked best for me. It honestly began working the very first day.  My thoughts were calmer, more regulated and controllable. It allowed me to stop the train that was rolling around in my head.  Inositol allows me to focus, be calm without trying, think clearly and see things for what they are, not what my OCD mind makes them out to be. I would say my symptoms have been reduced by 85-90% and after 25 years, that is substantial and I feel so blessed to have found this medication.  With regards to side-effects, when I first began taking the medication, I would get a slight headache, a little dizziness and in the evening the drowsiness was more pronounced; but after about a week, those side effects subsided.  On a different note, I have also found that my skin and hair have become healthier; I have a lot more energy; I don't crave sweets as much as I use to and it has boosted my libido exponentially. I know that each individual is different and that this medication affects everyone differently.

This notion came about when a number of people in Europe in the late '90s and early 2000s developed liver failure after taking kava products. Some of these included stems and leaves, which have been known by traditional users in Pacific Island cultures to be toxic and are never used. Some unscrupulous herbal supplement companies used these in products that were available at that time. The notion of kava liver toxicity has since been experimentally proven false. And empirically, if kava root was harmful, millions of Pacific Islanders would have a higher rate of liver failure than others. This is simply not the case. In traditional use, only the root is used in water-based infusions. I make it the traditional way. Kava products in pill and tinctures are absolutely useless, worthless, and are a waste of money. So, you should inform yourselves before you make these assertions.",7

So from that I'd logically assume it'd work for the withdrawal process --since it successfully proxied *for* my normal prescribed benzo.

Of course I go a bit above the extract's recommended dose, i.e. instead of counting 30-60 drops exactly I simply squirt about 10 mL right into my mouth. And that amount, 10 mL, at first gives me a 'warm' relaxed feeling, then I go into a very deep sleep for a solid 8 hrs. Not sure that it gives a 'euphoria', I think it's more like a slight anti-depressant effect. But yes, the right amount will make you sleep quite well. A little too well, possibly.

So in conclusion I'd not hesitate to recommend this for benzodiazpeine withdrawal, from my experiences with pure Kava extract. Because of it's 'warmly' relaxing effect I'd tend to believe it could be quite useful in cases of opiate withdrawal, too.",5

It also stopped the benefits of drugs that were helping my chronic Fatigue.  I found myself exhausted still the next morning.  The only dose I could tolerate was 1/4 capsule and still be able to function.  It has a sedative effect that made me unable to care properly for my visiting grandchildren.  Caution - DO NOT plan on using power tools while on this supplement.  I had started to feel better on a Chinese herb but once I started Lemon Balm all those benefits disappeared.  It's not worth the effort and cost.  Keep track of your symptoms and open the pill and pour out what you do not need.  I also poured some of the powder into water and it tasted fine - like a lightly flavored tea.  The problem was that every time I used it I had to counteract the bad side effects with the Chinese herb.

I've been taking lemon balm for almost three months. The change in how I react and deal with every day issues is amazing. Recently I took time off from work and I realized this is the first time in so many years I didn't sit and fester over issues, worry that I would lose control over my job or don't have an immediate reaction that I'm being conspired against in my absence. Not to say this doesn't happen especially in my company, but with the calmness comes the ability to sift through it all and deal with it confidently so that I don't come off as paranoid or that I'm just out to attack others. And other every day things such as going out into public into places I'd felt uncomfortable in/at has changed. It has also affected how I deal with customers. I'm much easier to interact with and don't get all sound up over service issues. I use lemon balm as well as suntheanine and its a win.

The outbreak was healed within 4 days without 'flowering'.  After reviewing comments about Vit D, will discontinue it in high doses going forward for use in minimizing my cramps and be more aware. Oil can be strong on sensitive skin so be careful when applying to private areas as even small amounts can burn. Try cocoa butter or coconut oil as a base to prevent this. Smell is strong but tolerable. Extremely happy with this treatment and recommend its use in your campaign to manage this condition. Said to be effective on preventing mouth cold sores as well.

I didn't have depression, anxiety, or any mood disorder; apart from the hair-pulling, I was completely healthy. After stopping Abilify cold-turkey (my doctor at the time told me this would be okay; she was WAY wrong), I experienced an intense 5-day-long anxiety attack.  Just constant panic, depression, crying, and depersonalization. On day 5, the ""episode"" ended just as suddenly as it began.

Ever since then, I'd have weeks of normalcy--even a slight euphoria--and then about 3 days of anxiety and depression that would, again, start without warning, and end just as suddenly.  Sometimes it was 3 days, sometimes more; sometimes it was so bad I couldn't function. Some episodes were more mild, but still very disrupting my life. I also began to pull more hair than ever.

I saw many doctors and was diagnosed with everything from General Anxiety, to Postpartum Depression (I gave birth a year ago), to Bipolar disorder. I knew in my heart the Abilify had caused this, somehow.

I read in a few forums about people having great success with TwinLab Amino Fuel, L-glutamine powder, and magnesium (all three taken together in the mornings on an empty stomach--I take 40 mL, 1 teaspoon, and 250 mg, respectively). I decided to give it a try, since I was desperate, and Abilify had scared me off psychiatric drugs permanently.

Within a week, I felt a LOT better. I started taking another 250 mg magnesium before bed, and now (2 months later) I feel even better, almost 100%. I do get ""twinges"" of anxiety now and then, but they are so mild and fleeting, I barely notice them; on these days I take an extra magnesium midday. I know the other supplements are helping a lot too, but the magnesium is great just by itself. It feels like I have my life back!! Highly recommend no matter what kind of anxiety you have.",73

Still have some pain and cramps but now its manageable and I sleep all night! What aggravates me is why none of the doctors in the last 8 years have ever checked my magnesium levels. I guess they were too busy prescribing drugs for me. I personally would rather fix the problem instead of band-aiding it. Hope someone finds this helpful and finds the same relief I did.",119

Because I am post-menopausal and have osteopenia,along with the other fun symptoms of menopause (not sleeping, profusely sweating with hot flashes and so on), I thought the magnesium good advice. Just a word of caution...do NOT, as I did, double the dosage. I purchased 500 mg capsules, already eat a great diet with plenty of natural magnesium intake, and thought more would be better. One per day as recommended is better. At two, you will spend part of your night in the bathroom. If you are constipated, I'd say magnesium is a great solution to that problem! :-) Good luck!",9

Then menopause hit--and with it, anxiety.  My doctor has been great about working with me, trying combinations of anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds, but I still had generalized anxiety with bouts of extreme anxiety so intense that only 2-3 Atavan could mitigate.  I had long since given up caffeine and other stimulants, and I haven't been able to drink in years due to GI troubles, so I even tried cannabis, which helped a tiny bit but is no good for work and driving and housework.  That's when a friend gave me a baggie of ""high-dose"" passion flower caplets.  After an initial period with one caplet three times a day, I noticed a great reduction in anxiety and a delightful elevation in mood.  I finally had a mood, and it wasn't always a bad one.  After a couple of weeks, I hit a bad spell, so I doubled up (2000 x 3), and I started feeling better within 15 minutes of dosing and much, MUCH better after two hours.  I ran out while trying to find 1000 mg caplets and waiting for the delivery from Puritan Pride, so I have been having trouble again: I am functioning functionally, but I am so uncomfortable.

I have 3-4 cups throughout the day with a tablespoon or a bit more of the dried herb, and usually have two cups at once a little while before bed. This helps with my social anxiety, generalised anxiety, and my insomnia. It works better for the anxiety, but it gets me relaxed enough to encourage sleep. 

The tea: The dried herb I have is of cheaper and not as high quality as others I have had, so I adjust measurements as needed. 
Ingredients:
- 1-2 tablespoons dried passionflower
- 6-8 oz water
- Honey to taste (optional)

Bring the water to a boil, either in a mug in the microwave or on the stove, remove from heat, and add passionflower. Cover and allow to steep for 10 minutes. (If you have a tea ball or tea mug infuser for loose teas, use it. If not, you will have to strain the passionflower out by hand using a strainer.)

I see that it is recommended as a ""calming"" agent, and I agree with that. The good thing about using Skullcap to reduce my sex drive is that, when my wife IS in the mood, I can still perform - and I actually notice a bit of improvement in my staying power. When I am not called on to perform, I simply notice it less. Sex isn't in the ""top 5"" of daily distractions like it used to be.

It did not seem to help with my depression at all, aside from giving me a little more energy. I have taken St. John's wort many times in my life, and as long as I remembered to take it on a fairly regular basis, it lifted my spirits and improved my outlook on life tremendously. I am so grateful to know about this herb. I often take ginko biloba with it in addition to a healthy dose of fish oil daily. I always say that it makes me feel like myself again! And that feels good!
   My problem is that once I really start feeling well again, I begin to start forgetting to take my supplements on a regular basis, because I don't ""need"" them anymore. And then eventually, I stop taking them altogether and somewhere down the line, I end up depressed and where I started again. I'm sure if I had stayed on a regimen of taking my supplements, everything would have been fine.
   The only side effect I had was sensitivity to the sun. I got really sunburned when I went on vacation to Hawaii. So definitely be careful in the sun. I am a freckled Irish girl, so I'm already susceptible ( and stupid, obviously). So wear your sunscreen!!

I've been using St. John's Wort for several years, but I remember the first 6 months of using it daily and feeling as though it was not working. This is a natural plant not altered by chemicals, so expecting it to work like medication is an unreasonable expectation! Secondly, there is more obligation on your behalf than just orally consuming the pill, or tea. First, you have to actually following the instructions on each bottle. (Each one varies!) Next, you have to exhibit some physical activities to help increase your own natural chemicals; therefore, enhancing the Hypericum perforatum effect. I love it and I will never go without it!!! (Unless, chemist begin to try and add other chemicals, like antidepressants and anxieties). Lastly, if you were taking antidepressants or anti anxieties, your body must first completely detox from them and begin to naturally level you chemical imbalances (within your brain). Otherwise, you can expect results to be the same as someone who has used Oxycodone for a year, and randomly decided to use Ibuprofen for the pain.

My partner looked into herbal remedies and came across St John's Wort and I started taking it about 2 weeks ago. After a couple of days, I was feeling so much more relaxed and less anxious. Now a couple of weeks on and I have been so much more positive about life in general.

I had not idea what was happening to me and did some online research and found that I was suffering from anxiety, after finding out that millions of people suffer from anxiety, I felt a sense of ease. But the attacks continued and I did not want to see a doctor because i fear doctors,nor did I want to be heavily medicated and become zombied out (a person I really am not)So I looked for natural remedies. I can not remember exactly what webpage I went to but I read up on St. John's Wort and found that it was a something I could buy over the counter. I am writing this because a friend of mine called me crying stating she was having a panic attack. I explained how I suffered and got through it by taking these natural pills. I explained to her every symptom I had sweaty palm, heart racing, the sense of dizziness or dying feeling and we related to one another so I wanted to write on here something I regularly don't do but if I can help at least one person. It would make me a pretty happy guy because if you are reading this I know what you are going through and YOU can overcome it. I did and so will you ",15

The cost is very cheap, the side effects are very minimal and Along with a good diet, exercise and other ways to keep up good health it makes a good addition!

The skin on my hands did become very, very sensitive.  So much so that slight bumps or slight scratches were very painful.  This pain was not just at the moment of impact, but would go on for some seconds following the impact.  I was also more light sensitive, but the pain on my skin was the most problematic.  It was a worthwhile trade-off to lift the depression, though.  And when I was well established in my normal mood range I gradually reduced the amount of the supplement.

She told me that it is very common for adult women to go undiagnosed for a long period of time.  I am not comfortable going to a “cognitive therapist” to “examine” me or to have that on my medical record. So I went to Clarks Nutrition Store in Rancho Mirage. A nutritionist there explained that in adults ADD can be easier to manage as an adult because we recognize what is right and wrong behavior and we need to address my sleep pattern first because lack of sleep magnifies the problems of those who suffer with ADD. So, he suggested working on my insomnia and racing behavior that leaves me running around trying to complete my multiple tasks that I should have never started at one time. Basically in a nutshell he said if my sleep is more sound, my cognitive function will improve drastically.  I have now almost completed my bottle, while this is not a miracle pill, in the first week I did sleep deeper.  Initially I found I was sleepy in the middle of the day and found I woke up at 4:30 am promptly for that week (I am NOT a morning person!) so I am playing with the distribution of the time I take them. His suggestion was to take one on an empty stomach during the day while my mind is MOST active, twice a day. I tried 10-11am and 8-9pm but now I am trying 10-11am and 3-4pm I awoke at 7:30 which is much better. Overall I am extremely satisfied and am going to make this a permanent part of my day. I am not cured of my symptoms but I do feel a systematic change in my symptoms.  The daytime sleepy thing was only about the first week.  It has now been in my body almost a whole month.  It is something you have to give a whole 2-3 weeks to have an overall feel for how it will work with your system.  I told my husband last night, “ I don’t feel cured but I definitely feel something better.” of course, he is just happy that I get to bed sometime before 2 a.m every night and I am too!",19

I take blood pressure medication; it can make your pressure lower. So far, I don't feel badly or feel lightheaded, etc. I will definitely mention this supplement to my physician at my next well care visit which is soon. Granted, they are not God, and I am a believer that sometimes you have to do what is best for your body.  However, for the most part, I do trust their knowledge and advice and they have my medical history and we go from there.  I feel we should do this when taking any supplement as it MAY contain SOME of the very same substances in SOME of the medications we use. This is why we must use caution when taking supplements no matter how ""natural"" they may appear. Overall, This supplement seems to work for me (as it has for many). I haven't been on it for very long. I also read (in different areas that one shouldn't be on this supplement for too long a period of time). Again - another caution. Again - a question we should take to out physician and one we should ask ourselves. If it seems to be helping us and our overall health is good, blood work, pressure, mental health, etc, etc., then why not take it....in moderation of course.  ",9

It leaves an intense feeling of calm, a lot like Valium minus the drowsiness and motor skill impairment.
I would not recommend it as a daily preventative, if you know you are going into a situation that causes anxiety (like the dr.s office, flying,etc) take it before hand and it will work just fine. This is a fast/short acting medicinal product, alot like ""rescue"" inhalers for asthma. it is not really meant to be taken every day; only when you have a problem but it is safe to take it everyday if it is needed. If you suffer from the occasional anxiety or panic attack or situational anxiety/specific phobia this medication may help. So far the only side effect i have found is that it makes me sleepy if i am sleep deprived when i take the L Theanine. 
* Very relaxing
* non sedating
* use as needed
* fast acting (kicks in 20-30 minutes)
* make make you sleepy if sleep deprived 
* may lower blood pressure
* counteracts caffeine jitters but increases caffeine's ability to make you alert. ",88

Valerian does have a chance to not work or even backfire, keeping you awake, based on several points.  This is why I always mix it with other sedative/calming herbs; usually skullcap, sometimes hops, passion flower, lemonbalm, or catnip.  This lessens the chance of it not working.

Got that fixed and felt great but the ""falling and staying asleep' never corrected itself fully. I have to take an ambien and most often a Xanax at night. Started taking the valarien root and after 2 weeks I was mad I thought I wasted my money until about week 3 to 4 noticed I went 5 hours without waking up. I was stunned. Now let me be clear that it did nothing for me to help fall asleep but has made a hug difference in staying asleep longer and better quality of sleep. Still have to take ambien but every other night I half the ambien dose. I always want to be clear that I tried melatonin and it caused beyond horrible nite mares so I threw them away after 3 nights of that mistake. I also take vitamin C and D with no magnesium stelate in it.

1969,27,9/6/2013 11:30:12 PM,Other,25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Consumer),3,4,1,"This seemed to either cause or exacerbate some really bad delusions that also contributed to me taking way too much of this herb afterward, and may have contributed to severe euporic mania (not the hyper sort; I was relaxed) and depression (whereas it was minor before by comparison), as well as some strange Tourette's type motion-based tics. I'm kind of OCD. So, the obsessions I have mingled with the delusions. It made things difficult. They weren't fixed obsessions, but ones that shifted, although they would generally recur within a few minutes to months. They were very intelligent obsessions that gained personality in my manic phase.

Valerian did relax me when first taking it. However, either over time or when I stopped taking it (not sure which), I got like panic attacks with bad delusions. Never had those before. This may be related to another herb that the delusion convinced me to take, though.

I don't know for sure if valerian was the cause, but that was the first and only part of my life where I took it. I'm not on any medications, and have never been on anything for a mental illness.

It may have also just have been me going extra crazy for some unknown reason, but that's never happened before.

I used Naturalist brand Valerian root. My sister and Mother use it and love the stuff. They have no problems with it.

My side effects (if that's what they were) lasted a long time. I got nightmares and stuff, too. They were incredibly dreadful. I had nightmares before this, but not as bad. My intrusive thoughts got worse. To help keep nightmares away, If listen to church music while I slept, sleep with the light on our such. Turning the fan on May have helped.

Another side effect seemed to be something kind of like sleep paralysis, if that's not what it was. I've actually heard that can be a valerian side-effect, though. The other stuff I've mentioned is new as far as my research has found.

This was like a side effect worse than death.",1

   So when I read these postings desribing bad side affects,...I wondered,..is this for real OR is it being given a bad rap because it works and any guy can buy it online or at a gealthfood store and is not a prescription,  which translated means tgat Drug companies cannot make money off it, other than to negativley brand it as bad/dangerous, while pushing Viagra, or Extenze or any other lab made $$$$ drug?
   Like I said,..I've been using tjis stiff for Decades and,...I'm still here, and no problems as the Pharma paid doctors have written.
  Yohimbe has been used for thousands of years in other countries where amwrican drug corporations are not able to negatively brand it.
  I for one can say it works, it is natural, it is cheap,...and that's why drug pa

corporations don't like it.",4

I've noticed that the old 'steel libido' supplements list far too high of a dose for someone ~170lb mid twenties. It says take 4, thats about 10mg of yohimbine. If you evenly spaced these throughout the day you would probably never sleep. I can take 1 [2.5 mg!!!] and sleep after 5-6 hours have passed. Sensitization comes with use, but there is also something called adrenal fatigue. I don'tt associate any lingeriing toxicity with this, nor would I ever be tempted to take a high dose.

Once I had a bag of 5 grams of yohimbine hcl. I was at a music festival in south america.. havin a good time. I showed some friends I'd met there my bag of yohimbine hoping to trade it for goods or goodwill. I was trying very hard to communicte the dose in spanish to them. They really didn't get the miligrams part of it. The guy dipped his finger in the powder, and I cautioned him profusely en espanol. he licked a dusting of powder off his finger. I saw him later and asked if he was ok. He admitted that it was very strong, as I had initially cautioned him that it was.

I would recommend, personally, the freebase form of yohimbine as it has favorable vaporization characteristics, and I personally would not heat an HCL in hopes it would do anything but decompose. Yohimbine has favorable vasodialation properties, the problem is getting it to the brain around the digestive system, where it tends to just do all sorts of stuff nobody likes.

also I think topical yohimbine has been done or suggested. Get the form right, do your research if you want to go that route. Yohimbine lube anyone? Achieve what none have thought possible... a 6 hour erection. The question is, how long does consent really take? Or, in relative terms, how many thrusts?",1

It WORKED, but the side effects for me were horrific.  I took 5mg of yohimbine HCl around 2pm.  No hunger AT ALL for the rest of the day, but I experienced the heart palpitations, some dizziness and the worst diarrhea of my life.  After about 6 hours, it subsided, however I woke up every 1 hour that night with a RELENTLESS erection.  Never having had any ED issues, this was NOT an added benefit to me.  To hopefully get rid of the erection, I ""took care of myself.""  It went away, but kept coming back all night.

I sought treatment in every form possible without any significant improvement. I stumbled across Yohimbe in a work out supplement. While using it my ED is all but gone and I have greatly increased sex drive...that being said the side-effects are harsh. I have noticed mildly increased blood-pressure (not enough to be dangerous), insomnia (in high doses this can last up to 24 hours and is the worst side effect), occasional headaches, nervousness and frequent urination. Through trial and error I have found that even a low dosage (approximate 30 mg) of Yohimbe can be effective and the smaller the dose the more manageable the side effects. I see that lots of people complain about nausea. They need to do more research. A side effect of Yohimbe is difficulty processing tyramine. If you eat anything containing tyramine (red wine, cheese, red meat) you are going to have a bad time. Avoid those foods and you will be OK as far as nausea is concerned. Final Summary: It works just avoid the foods above and keep the dose small. In a small dose the effects last about 8 hours. ",6

I think Yohimbe is no better than drinking 10 cups of coffee all at once which is unhealthy to do.

I read the reviews of R. rosea, and they were almost all positive, so I bought the Swanson 400mg capsules just because I was curious about it.  I am overly sensitive to a lot of drugs.  Two beers and I'm buzzed, one cup of coffee and I'm super jittery and can't sleep.  So I knew I needed a smaller dose.  It's apparently hard to find in capsules smaller than 400mg.  So I have been unscrewing the capsule and taking only about 1/8 to 1/4 of it (50-100mg), just once in the morning when I wake up, and only take it once every 2 days.  It definitely has stimulant properties.  I've seen many benefits and only 1 or 2 negatives (that may go away over time).  Benefits: More energy, similar to caffeine but without feeling jittery, and no afternoon crash.  Better focus at work without getting tired, along with less anxiety from work stress (priceless). A slight euphoric feeling for the first couple of hours after I take it.  A slight increase in heart rate.  Less snack cravings.  I feel more outgoing and less introverted (I'm normally a quiet guy).  My workouts have been easier in terms of perceived effort, and I feel less tired afterward.  I seem to recover faster than before.  Last but not least I have noticed my libido increase, which I honestly didn't expect at all.  The negatives: I get a slight headache about 2 hours after I take it, and it goes away by the afternoon.  The headaches seem to be going away slowly as I get accustomed to it.  The night of the first day I took it, I went to bed still having a lot of energy, and was unable to sleep for a while, so I took a tylenol pm, and fell right asleep.  Overall though, it's been great.  So glad I discovered it, and thanks for everyone who posted reviews of it!!",28

After recovering from these illnesses I was always exhausted by the end of the work day and had no energy for anything else. after a couple of weeks I began to feel generally better. Now I feel great. I don't feel like crying all the time and have energy to do the things I love instead of being a couch potato who fell asleep on the couch every evening. I also feel like being social again. Before taking Rhodiola I didn't want tomgomout at all and stayed at home as much as I could. My entire attitude to life has changed. I had a complete hysterectomy at the age of 45 and everything gradually went downhill until now. Feeling well and wanting to do things again has also helped me lose weight and I am much better at coping with the worry of two 90 year old parents with significant health issues. I feel great!!!!!,28

So, for mood and energy I've found it to be great. HOWEVER, both my husband and I have noticed a notable loss of memory when taking it--can't remember names of people, or can't put a face with a name when I otherwise would. This change in memory was troubling enough that my husband quit using rhodiola. I try to use it only during the last two weeks of my cycle, when I am most prone to mood problems, and try to put up with the memory problems then.  I do worry, though, about what everyday or longterm use would do to memory.  I hope researchers will look into this rhodiola/memory connection.

Reaction to this drug was extremely negative(constant extreme anxiety, paranoia and even a brief period of suicidal thoughts). Stopped zoloft and tried exercise plus diet and although I was not as bad, I still had issues. Read about rhodiola root and decided to try it due to the low toxicity. Started with 100 mg/day and within 24 hours I could feel the benefit. I wasn't in a permanently bad mood. After 2-3 days I was slipping back to brief anxiety attacks. Raised it up to 200 mg/day (first thing in the morning before breakfast and 30 minutes before lunch). 3 weeks later and I'm 100% better. I no longer have anxiety attacks even when doing presentations in front of large audiences. This herb has changed my life. I've read hours and hours of different reviews of various herbs and remedies. One thing I've learned is that each body is different and you'll need to try to see what is right for you.

However, a year ago I began experiencing issues with peripheral vascular disease associated with varicose veins (ulcerations and subcutaneous bleeding on my calves, joint pain and stiffness, planar fasciitis and chronic leg cramps). 

Within weeks of treating my varicose veins with compression stockings and elevation, I noted increased postural tachycardia, which became debilitating after 3 months (could no longer work). While waiting to see my PCP, I came off the melatonin and both my tachycardia and varicose veins began improving significantly. Three weeks after discontinuing its use, the tachycardia disappeared and the varicose veins improved enough to allow me to go without compressions stockings for intervals of several hours.

Have found nothing to explain the correlation but for a study in European Journal of Phramocology, vol 345, 1 March 1998 (NIH medical journal database), where the authors discuss the presence of MT1 & MT2 receptors (to which melatonin binds) in smooth muscle of vascular tissue and their role in vasodilation and constriction, respectively, as an explanation for melatonin’s systemic efficacy.

While my overall condition improved when I discontinued use, I did experience a brief period of cognitive impairment and an uptick in mean blood pressure, the latter of which may require me to seek treatment should it persist. Finally have a follow-up with a cardiologist.

But the problem is, each brand and dose of melatonin (and possibly each ""batch"") is SO different. A few brands have worked consistently better than prescription sleep aids for me, but unfortunately MOST brands are either ineffective, or produce the opposite effect desired (eg, I needed a Xanax to counteract the nervous, gittery feelings, then I still couldn't sleep but at least I wasn't jittery.)

One 3mg brand I like is pretty consistent for me (and $3/month! cheap!), but the same brand has a few other doses, plus a ""dissolvable"" 3mg dose with sweetening added, and of course all the bottles look the same, so I've accidentally bought the wrong ones (or if the right ones were sold out, tried another dose): ALL the other doses of the ""good brand"" didn't work. And the sugary one gave me the ""nervousness"" effect.

After a few YEARS of trying melatonin for sleep (on and off), though I have a decent one now, I really think the FDA should be looking at what these vitamin companies put into these pills. At least there should be consistency from ""batch to batch"" (same brand/dose).

So when you hit luck with a good one, it's very effective. But it really feels like a crapshoot when you open the next bottle. I'd love to put my brand/dose as 5-star satisfaction, but since this review is just ""melatonin"", I've got to consider the rest of my experiences with melatonin. Mostly positive, but even the few times I've gotten ""the jitters"" ...why package and sell a sleep aid that makes insomnia a nightmare?

I like that it is not addictive. I particularly like it when my schedule is irregular and I need to get to bed earlier than normal for an early am appointment. It gets you sleepy in about 20 mins. (of course it's best to start settling down for the evening). It is a dream enhancer though, the higher the dose as in 5-10mg the more one will tend to dream. This can make one feel as though they haven't slept. Best to start with a small dose and increase until you find a dosage that makes you sleepy in the 20 min range. Then go to bed. If you don't your body will just work it through and it will do no good. I also like to combine this with Valerian root which produces a sound sleep. Also non addictive. One of each on any given work night is about the right dose for me.  The melatonin dose is 1mg and the valerian is 500 mg.  I have taken up to 10 mg of melatonin with no ill effects, however you will need 8-11 hours of sleep with that dosage and you may still wake up groggy. I have also taken up to 2000 mg of valerian root with no ill effects and no grogginess (in case you have never taken valerian root it smells like dirty socks, really dirty socks lol).  Both products are relatively inexpensive. My size is 5'4"" and I weight around 145-150. Judge your dosage according to your size. I have used nearly all makes and models of both products",13

Added 50 mg Bendryl (diphenhydramine)per night a few years ago and have not needed to change either dose since. I sleep through the night and wake up refreshed but sometimes a bit groggy. A good cardio workout takes care of that. Very important - try cutting down, or better, eliminating caffeine. 
I've tried a number of brands of melatonin, but many don't work. I've settled on Natrol, because it works. There are probably others that work also, but I haven't seen any reason to experiment unless/until the Natrol becomes unavailable or stops working. Remember that these are not manufactured as drugs and there is no required test for what's in the tablet. If the first brand doesn't work for  you, try others until you find one. That doesn't mean you will necessarily succeed - melatonin doesn't work for everybody. Try it, though. Start with low doses and adjust as you see how it affects you. Good luck!",54

Rather than put me to sleep it woke me up and gave me moe energy in the first few hours after taking it each night my dreams or rather My nightmares were much much more vivid  and memorable, before this i cannot remember having or at least remembering any dreams in the last 6 months. When I did sleep, every third day or so, my sleep was much shorter topping out between 3 and  hours. Then for the 2 days after I stopped taking it I slept about 21 hours a day and was extremely groggy when I was awake (afterwards, that is after the 2 day snooze fest, I returned to my normal insomnia problems.)But the worst side effect, reportedto me by family and coworker, was that while I kept taking the melatonin I was extremely irritable, easily annoyed and angered, not to mention so energized and thinking and talking a mile a minute most of the time when I had to be really alert for work, I guess to compensate my groginess (a sort of adrenaline rush of some kind and I imagine it was like some people feel when on speed or something, or immediately after coming off of it. It got so bad at one point that I was suspended for three days from my management job because I scared an employee and maybe even a few. Which is the exact opposite of what people usually tell me, i.e. I am usually so patient, happy, understanding, forgiving and helpfull.    Anyway, that was my experience of it.

2469,34,4/28/2014 9:01:30 PM,Benzodiazepine withdrawal,"John shepherd, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months",3,5,3,"Benzodiazepines cause tolerance and physical dependence within two to four weeks, and, upon cessation acute withdrawal traditionally requires tapered management. Additionally in some long term users experience withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal syndrome can last many months and is typified by a major depressive episode, agitation, and lack of ability to get to sleep. This is a serious side effect which needs careful monitoring.
ol
For this reason Benzodiazepines need to be used with extreme caution and for very short periods.

Melatonin is effective for sleep disturbances that are not caused by an over active nervous system, such is in the case of Benzodiazepine withdrawal. It appears virtually ineffective during acute (tapered) withdrawal, although somewhat helpful during withdrawal syndrome. For this reason it's main purpose during withdrawal is an adjunct with other therapies.

To my knowledge Melatonin does not effect the calcium channels that have been disturbed by benzodiazepine usage and this is why, in my view, Melatonin is not very effective on it's own as an Anxiolytic (antianxiety agent.)

My experience is that SSRI's are not very effective for use for withdrawal, however responses to SSRI's are individual dependant.

It is essential to manage benzodiazepine withdrawal and protracted withdrawal syndrome using a variety of methods including CBT, but most effectively, using an alternative Anxiolytic, the most effective of which is Phenibut (CALMEXA).

Phenibut Calmexa is GABA with a phenyl ring that allows it to pass the blood brain barrier, therefore replacing the GABA depleted by benzodiazepine dependence. With medical management it can safely and entirely replace the use of Benzodiazepines, causing an alternative dependence both easier to taper with less risk of protracted withdrawal syndrome. 

Melatonin used together with Phenibut is very effective for inducing sleep, establishing and maintaining a sleeping pattern.

My pain tolerance is so high that even the class 2 meds i take give short term relief. One doc in the er came back after giving pain shot and was shocked I was still awake saying I gave you enough to knock out a horse. He had not seen that high tolerance before.
I was unable to use my cpap correctly because I was tossing and turning in pain or discomfort in finding a comfortable sleep position and waking up because of the apnea.   I have had  chronic insomnia for over 20 years tried everything including prescription meds. Tried melatonin appropriate 2 months ago. Been able to get at least 4 to 5 straight hours of sleep. Wake up not drowsy and feeling more rested than I have in years. From a chronic pain and insomnia suffered this gives me hope. I use to be so tired during the day from restless night. I know there was strain on my heart and body due to constant lack of sleep. Now I can use the cpap with the goal of reaching 6 to 8 hours.

Trouble falling and staying asleep. Erratic work schedule. I use melatonin infrequently but with extremely high doses (ie used 20mg last night). Result: vivid dreams, but it helps to keep me asleep.

I'm reviewing just to let people know that this dosage is safe for me (I feel well rested, still tired but not wired, not irritable). The dreams are to be looked out for, like I said extremely vivid especially the first couple times using melatonin.
The diagnose of fibro should convey to readers that I have experienced chronic physiological (specifically muscular and nervous system) arousal for prolonged periods of time (10-15 years) due to environmental and emotional stress & poor cultural/familial support for stress resolution. Worst instance of emotional stress from 9-22 years old. It has not been fun.

Taking 5mg didn't kick in until an hour had passed, but I would wake up almost every hour afterwards. Those moments of being awake were met with distorted vision/mild hallucinations. Every wake felt like a power nap, and I'd force myself to sleep again. 

The hallucinations involved watery vision, where everything resembled liquid waves, and complete distortion of light. I've only experienced something similar in my childhood during a shroom trip. As far as I know I'm the only person in my circle to ever experience this melatonin trip effect, and unlike the shrooms it was nonstimulant and basically I thought I was going crazy. 

Upped the dose to 10mg the next night just to test, and it was identical, no more or less crazy.

I suppose this works for some people, but I really can't handle whatever it is doing to my mind or body. Like I said before tho, I must be a super rare case.",11

I take 3mg of melatonin approximately mid-day to advance my sleep phase.  The timing needs to be precise in relationship to my internal body clock, which is not always easy to know.  If I wake after an hour of heavy dream sleep, my waking time is a reliable marker and I will take melatonin eight hours later.  If I hit the right timing window, I'll have fairly strong fatigue within an hour.  This lasts for a couple of hours.  I can't do certain kinds of work in this state, but I can do housework and listen to lectures.  I call it my stupid pill, but it doesn't actually make me stupid, but impairs my ability to generate outward focus.  Missing my window even once can make it hard to recover the required timing accuracy.  The difference is profound.  I can tell I miss the window because I have far less fatigue.  Taking coffee at the same time as the melatonin significantly reduces fatigue, but it also made the treatment less reliable.  Used to have an ""all nighter"" without fail at least once every three weeks for twenty years.  In my first year on melatonin, I lost control only three times and had to flip over.  Variability in the potency messed me up on one of those.  One vendor didn't work at all.  Another vendor works well most of the time, but some bottles aren't all there.  Think I get mild stomach irritation at night, nothing really to complain about, and it could be other things in the pill.  My life is spectacularly better since I discover this, having found the research myself.  Would love to find a 100% consistent formulation.

Anyways it has been a God send. I finally know what quiet adult time is at night. I read to her a bit and soon she is asleep. 
Melatonin as mentioned does not keep her asleep all night (which isn't a problem for us). There is no drowsiness in the morning, in fact she is much less cranky and refreshed. I can't say how thankful for this product I am!

It has had the opposite effect for me. It is the only thing I have done differently so I know it has to be the answer. Not long after taking this extract, my heart started beating really fast and I felt twinges....this is not normal at all for me. Then I got a horrible headache. My head is still pounding. Stupid me, I took the second dose later. Same thing. I still feel just awful and can not wait for this passionflower extract to be out of my system.

I plan on continuing to use it for a very long time, as it had helped immensely with both! I make tea out of it as it seems to be the best economical decision for the long run. I have 3-4 cups throughout the day with a tablespoon or a bit more of the dried herb, and usually have two cups at once a little while before bed. This helps with my social anxiety, generalised anxiety, and my insomnia. It works better for the anxiety, but it gets me relaxed enough to encourage sleep. 

The tea: The dried herb I have is of cheaper and not as high quality as others I have had, so I adjust measurements as needed. 
Ingredients:
- 1-2 tablespoons dried passionflower
- 6-8 oz water
- Honey to taste (optional)

Bring the water to a boil, either in a mug in the microwave or on the stove, remove from heat, and add passionflower. Cover and allow to steep for 10 minutes. (If you have a tea ball or tea mug infuser for loose teas, use it. If not, you will have to strain the passionflower out by hand using a strainer.) Remove passionflower, stir in honey or your sweetener of choice, and enjoy!

Simultaneously, my depressed mood improved very significantly. Chicken or the egg?

However, after reading reviews/ratings here, I may consider increasing this dosage from 2 to 3 softgels daily.  Thanks so much to all contributors!  This is an awesome resource for information!  Scientific studies necessarily lag behind first-hand experiences...

I take 2000 mg of omega 3s in fish oil daily with fluoxetine (Prozac) and it makes a HUGE difference.  I drive much slower, I'm much more patient, and people don't aggravate me half as much.

Fish oil works by reducing inflammation in the brain on a sub-cellular level which allows the neurotransmitters in the brain to be able function more efficiently without misfiring (which is believed to be the cause of many mood disorders).

Regardless if you're suffering general anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, or any number off issues, fish oil will only help.

Be sure to read the label, just because it says 1000 mg on the bottle means very little.  What is important are how many mg of actual omega 3s are in each capsule.  Most drug store brands have about 300mg of omega 3s and to be effective for mood disorders, you need 2000-3000 mgs of omega 3s daily.  Specifically EPA.

I have low blood pressure, chlorestorel is fine. I have been taking iron, 150 mg for over two years. Everytime I stop taking it, my iron levels plummet. If fish oil prevents blood clotting, ie thickening of blood,and can cause bleeding from the liver,, would taking this krill oil be causing me to lose iron? Just wanted to chime in with my theory. I think Ill stop taking it for awhile. The body doesnt need much fat. Hormones are made from chlorestorel. But think of the body as mostly water. What happens when you put oil, in water? It floats. Think of your blood. Basically, the oil is greasing up your blood. I have read studies about vit e and estrogen that state estrogen is inactive until activated by e, e is an oil. when activated by the wrong oil, it can trigger cancer. I even wonder if the body needs ANY external oils at all. This states that the omegas are not naturally made in the body. Then why supplument them? I looked up what oil actually is, and this is really gross, but oil is decaying life, ie human, and animal remains over millions of years. I think Ill work to keep my body as watery as possible. ",0

There's no *perceptible* difference that I can feel, and the very latest research from Yale, where the scientists combed through all the studies, is that the studies just don't show a connection between ingestion of EPA/DHA and relief of bipolar or depressive symptoms.  Michael Bloch's team at Yale found that there was no *meaningful* connection between use of DPA/EHA and these disorders.  (The article: Mol Psychiatry. 2012 Dec;17(12):1272-82. doi: 10.1038/mp.2011.100. Epub 2011 Sep 20.).

Then again, the research does indicate that omega-3s are helpful for cardiac pathology, and certainly they don't *harm* you, so I'm going to keep taking them.  I'm just going to be careful not to spend a fortune on them, and not to ignore other treatment options and put all my eggs in the Omega-3 basket.

I had been on the fish oil for so long, it did not occur to me that it could be the cause. The IBS slowly got worse to the point where I was tested for celiac disease and gluten intolerance - negative on both fronts. The IBS got to the point where I was having up to ten BM's a day - not diarrhea, just constantly in the bathroom. It was miserable -it was hard to go out for even a few hours. It actually caused me to change jobs from a 70% travel position to an inside position. I saw the 2013 NEJM data on the ineffectiveness of fish oil in cardiac conditions, saw my doc and told him I was going to discontinue the fish oil because it wasn't doing anything for the triglycerides and I saw no long term benefit. 4 weeks later ALL my IBS symptoms were gone. I told my doc and he was as shocked as I was - he'd never seen delayed onset IBS with fish oil. So if you have developed IBS in fish oil, talk to your doc and tell him that it can happen.
