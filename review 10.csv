The horse hates it and it's impossible to feed. So I decided to try it on myself. I'm 45 YO and extremely active but starting to struggle with weight maintenance and metabolism. I'm also sensitive to ANY kind of stimulant.
 On Cissus Quadrangularus I've only lost 2 lbs in 2 weeks. I'm assuming it's because of it's gelling effect making me feel less hungry before meals. Plus it works extremely well for interrupting cortisol if taken a bit before a meal. Its too early for me to tell if  the weight is simply me being more aware or truly the product. 

What has been the most apparent result how ever is 3 day female cycles, not week long, voluminous.  Women my age will understand what I mean. It's kind of like I'm 24 again in that respect.

 ALSO, I have chronically torn rotator cuffs in both arms and RA coming on in the shoulders knees and hands. ( my life has not been easy, nor easy on my body)

 I was MRI diagnosed, not self which often happens on here. The physical therapist told me at my age just keep doing what I am doing and when the tendons snap, he'll do surgery. Until then he wanted to just give me cortisone and Ketamine injections. Which I did once. Lost me insurance so I haven't had them again.
On the CQ,,, In only 2 weeks my shoulders have been feeling significantly improved, as well as my knees. My hands are only marginally better. My work and two very rigorous hobbies that make it difficult to expect any miracles.  

If you are buying this in bulk, you'll need to buy gel caps. Or wrap it in Organic, unbleached paper(sabot). The stuff tastes horrible, but for me I am seeing results worth the hassle and I like the idea of getting it in an un-processed to make it taste good form and being able to control my own dosage.

On top of that, I have 3 herniated disks in my lower back which have been a MAJOR source of pain for nearly 15 years. Until about 2 mos ago I dealt with pain with narcotics or nothing at all because I can't use Nsaids due to the neck fusion.
I was reading in the body building forums looking for help with tendon injuries and found many references to Cissus. I decided it was worth a try and am I glad I did. Pain in both shoulders went from an 8 pain to a two in only two days!! I was amazed. After about a week I noticed that my lower back pain was not interfering with my daily activities, limited as they where. How wonderful.
I stopped using Cissus three days ago. My shoulders still feel pretty good but my lower back is raging again today. Today I started my regular Cissus dosing, 2-4 a day. I'm having shoulder surgery tomorrow. I'm in hopes the Cissus will aid in my recovery as it has other reviewers.
If you have tendon or joint pain, I highly recommend giving this a try. The only thing you have to loose is ether the $30 or the pain. If it works for you, it'll be money well spent. Believe the reviewers here.",28

I now have osteoarthritis in my knee and ankle and would never even consider letting myself run out.

I would recommend taking 500 mg every 8 hours regularly, at the same times each day, for best effectiveness.  I also find I get my best relief from regular Glucosamine (shellfish-free) which is a great savings in money as it is so much cheaper than Chondroitin/MSM added varieties.  I can actually feel a huge increase in my pain with only just a 24 hour lack of my Glucosamine.  I don't get full relief of course, but would never be able to walk or get in/out of a car without it.

So i tried it on mysef again, but this time used plain Glucosamine SULFATE.  It didn't take long for me to start feeling a difference.....and my severe knee pain was reduced to nothing over time.  I have been using it ever since and can tell right away if I foget to take it or if a diff brand does not work as it should. Glucosamine SULFATE (not Glucosamine HCL) is the form originally studied for joint pain relief and is far more effective in my experience.  I am amazed that most of the products use Glucosamine HCL instead of Sulfate, but an earlier writer noted that Sulfate is more expensive to manufacture, which may explain it.  If you have not had success with the HCL form, try the Sulfate form before giving up on this miracle supplement.  Be sure to get a quality brand, too, because some are not as effective as others. Once you use one that works, you will be able to tell pretty quickly if you switch to one that is not as effective.  Good Luck!",78

I can not say enough about HA.  We are like our cars. My joints were no longer lubercated the way God designed them to be.  Post Op did not initiat that process.  I do not know if the oral HA is getting to the joints, or assisting my own body to produce the lubercation.  Millions world wide have issues, not the least metalosis.  It is such a simple solution and worth trying if we can get insurance to help with cost and get the FDA out of the way except to make sure the labels are correct on all HA or Hyaloronan products.

Started taking Jarrows powder. 1 g two times a day with vitamin C 1000 mg and glucasomnine 1500 mg. Increased dosage to 4grams twice a day. Sciatica gone. Arthritis diminished. VERY pleased. Did experience cleansing headache when dosage increased from 1 gram twice a day to 2 grams twice a day after 1 week at 1 gram. Drink more water. Headache gone after 2 days. Subsequent increases in dosage did not trigger headaches. Now at 4 grams twice a day. Breakfast and lunch. Other effects. Nails do seem to be sturdier. Hair a little thicker. Not dramatic but better. MSM provides a bit of an energy boost, but not a sugar buzz but just a feeling of more energy. It also seems to help mentally with mood. No doubt a chemical change but a comfortable change. Injured an achilles tendon two years ago and MSM seems to help. Also Apply DMSO directly to tendon area 3 times or so per week. Eliminates 95 percent of the discomfort. Amazing. Did not realize how much pain I was in. MSM is cheap and easy to use. Take with water. It is a little bitter like a headache powder but does not upset your stomach. I use it on my 11 year old lab. She seems better and her fur appears thicker. Any time I fill up the water bowl, she gets one gram. You owe it to yourself to give it a try. Start slow and if you get a headache, drink more water. Six weeks so far and I plan to continue to use this product. DMSO works for me too. Good luck.",26

I prayed for relief, only pain pills, nothing to make it better. I went to library to research what I could do, the book ""MSM the Miracle of pain relief & inflammation?"" I read the book went to the health food store and bought the Powdered MSM-within a few weeks I was able to get out of bed without a struggle & pain.  I continue taking MSM up to this day and use a compound on hands & knees for pain & Stiffness. It also gives me energy as I am also diabetic, hypothyroid condition.  I wish I could bath in MSM but I do soak my neuropathy feet in MSM. Someday, I hope to visit the Clinic in Portland, OR and get a intravenous medication, as my pain is on going depending on the weather or activity. MSM saved my sanity and has made the quality of my life good.  I'm not cripple cripple and have full mobility, the treatment plan for IHS is to use steroids, shots, ibuprofen, muscle relaxers which only made me worse. Today, at 70yrs. I can keep up with the 30 yr. olds, they wonder how I do it. Thank God for MSM. I recommend it to my family, friends, strangers, if they are  suffering and are not allergic to sulfur.

It was so severe, I could hardly lift my arm. Showering was an ordeal, because I didn't have enough range of motion to use my left arm to shower properly. My wife's cousin told me about MSM, and brought me a mixture of MSM and vitamin C powder (half-and-half) to try.

I began my dosage at 1/4 tsp. per day of a half-and-half, mixture of MSM and vitaminC powder. After a week, I increased the dose to 1/2 tsp. per day for a week; then increased the dosage to 3/4 tsp. per day the third week. 

Two or three days after I began taking the MSM, I began to feel better and had some improvement in my range of motion.  Three weeks into the treatment, the bursitis was gone, and I had full, pain-free range of motion in my shoulder. I continued taking the MSM mixture at 3/4 tsp. per day for two weeks after the bursitis disappeared. It has been more than 10 years, and the bursitis has not returned.

I stopped taking the MSM, because my job was a physically demanding one, and I found that the MSM caused my perspiration to smell awful. I stopped taking it because of that.

A word of advice for those who might experience stomach upset when taking MSM: mix it in juice or coffee, and it will help alleviate that problem. 

I found that increasing the dosage by too much at a time gave me a terrible headache at the base of my skull. I found that increasing the dosage by 1/4 tsp. at a time and keeping that dosage for a week before increasing the dosage kept the headaches from occurring.

MSM worked beautifully for me. It completely cured my bursitis.

The overview on this site says that it's safe for 3 months or less. Since it's naturally occurring nutrient, found in many foods and on the skins of most fruit, I think small doses on a daily basis would be safe. It is definitely an effective treatment for bursitis in larger doses; so it makes sense that small daily doses would help maintain joint and bursa health.

I read that it helps accelerate cell turnover and disposal of toxins and other 'garbage' as it does so, improving the quality of new cells so that you are basically rebuilding yourself better over time. I worked up to 4000mg daily (+ 3g vit C) over a month, and now maintain at 3000mg. I did find a lot of water was necessary, and for about 6-8 weeks I had mild detox symptoms that changed around. Like a teenager, I needed to sleep and eat more during the adjustment period. It also caused my menstrual cycle to shorten (both interval and duration) for two cycles, but the cramps and so on were much diminished and the cycle normalized after the first two; it remains shorter, but interval is back to normal. My skin, hair and nails are visibly improved. My nails are much stronger and my hair seems to be growing a little faster. Along with quercetin, MSM appears to be helping with allergies. I seem to recover better after exercise. I also use a topical MSM lotion on injured sites (feet, hip and low back, knee) for additional support. Due to multiple issues I have been taking various supplements for a long while with good effects, and so far I'd say the MSM protocol is in the top 5 discoveries I would recommend to anyone, along with magnesium (even better together). I look forward to the long term benefits.  To better tolerate the detox effects, work up slowly, adding 500mg a week to the target dose, and you can take extra for critical use after injuries or severe exertion (marathons, etc.). Extra water is essential as MSM can be drying and even constipating otherwise. MSM can be taken as a powder in beverages or in capsules. It's also available combined with C in  powdered drink packets for convenience during crises like illness or injury. ",123

I read a student paper I found online by someone named Stephanie Seneff regarding a thesis on sulfur deficiency. The part regarding the lipid raft made me want to try MSM for my condition. Also, according to the thesis, vegetarians are vulnerable to a dietary sulfur deficiency because of the depleting nutritional value in soil, so that is also applicable to me because I have been a vegetarian for about 13 years.

I can't taste MSM in plain water or flavored water. It tastes horrible in tea--even herbal tea. I don't know if it is because of the heat, or if MSM enhances the taste of tannins. 

I feel well, I lose about 2 pounds a week, and I have periods much more regularly now. It is difficult for me to pin it on a single cause, and I doubt it is because of one change anyway, but I have also made a lot of improvements to my nutritional intake, greatly reduced salts and simple carbohydrates in my diet, and am using essential oil extracts (such as tea tree and lavender) to help regulate my condition. 

My anus was a little sore for the first 1 1/2 days after I started taking MSM, but I put a little grapeseed oil on it once, and I haven't had a problem since.

I have started giving my dogs a teeny pinch of MSM in their water because they are also vegetarians and because dogs are known to have sore joints in old age. My childhood dog Sugar--who incidentally was not a vegetarian--became very sensitive in her joints roughly around her 14th birthday, and I'm trying to stop the same thing from happening to my current companions. There have not been any adverse consequences to date, but I did apply preemptive grapeseed oil.

I don't see my brand on the dropdown list, so for the record, I use Omica Organics Plant-Derived MSM crystals. Dose: 1/2 teaspoon two times daily.

I was taking 400 mg plaquenil, 400 mg celebrex, 20 mg prednisone, and 500 mg of pain killer a day which stopped about 75% of my pain, but after 8 months I had very little improvement in movement and felt like I was just stopping the pain, the underlying problem was not getting any better. I was begining to get desparate since my doctor was going to start reducing my prednisone, whichs was the main drug keeping my pain level down. I came across an article on MSM and thought I would give it a try. I was hoping that in 4-6 weeks I might see an improvement. I started out taking two 1000 mg capsules a day. I was amazed that after one day of taking MSM, I awoke the next morning aware that I felt much better than normal and that my pain was almost completely gone. I am definitely getting better everyday. I even forgot to take my other meds severaly times due to the fact that I was pain free. I can't say if this is going to be a permanent return to a normal life, but in my 62 years of having arthritis, nothing has ever helped reduce the pain as fast at MSM. I am only writing this in hopes that it may help someone else as much as it has me. I was just about ready to give up on life due to the extreme pain I was suffering. My rheumatoid factor was over 750 and my SED and CRP readings were also way off the charts. I have my fingers crosed that this is going to be a cure for my condition, not just a short term gain. My improvement may have been a coincidence with my starting MSM, but after 9 months of relentless pain, for what I experienced the day after starting MSM, I have to bet it was the MSM that stopped my pain.

I stopped catching colds and I was around sick people and children constantly. I kissed my wife who had just gotten strep and didn't catch it. It boosted my immune system. Some tendonitis I had in my hand went away. My allergies were not bad at all this season, but I am not sure yet if it has helped with the eczema. It didn't really do anything for my acid reflux either. I did notice wounds healed quicker and I got a boost of energy that felt like it came out of nowhere. Times of the day where I would feel exhausted are now times where I have energy and am ready to go workout or tackle heavy duty projects.

What I will say is that the dosages are very ambiguous. There doesn't seem to be a standard dose yet because there really isn't any extensive research that has been done. I currently take 3 - 1000mg doses a day with a meal. At this level I have been getting some slight headaches and minor reactions, so I am going to dial it back to 2 - 1000mg doses a day. 2000mg a day was what I was taking and getting no side effects.

I have a sensitivity to capsules so I mix a half teaspoon with a couple of teaspoons of applesauce twice daily. I switched to a Sam's Club brand and believe it is not as effective as my 30 year old Schilling spice.  I plan to continue testing with a product from a health food store until I decide what is best for me. I put a little extra pepper on my food to help the turmeric enter my body. Taking it once daily didn't seem to work as well as taking it twice daily in smaller amounts. I have noticed other areas of physical improvement that I might attribute to the turmeric but can't be sure.  Plus, I am a born skeptic so this product has truly surprised me.     ",0

I cannot tell you how happy this makes me to find this, given I was completely convinced it wouldn't work when the doctor suggested it (in fact I thought he was a bit nutty, but apparently I was completely wrong).

I guess tumeric can be deemed organic, but the extraction of the concentrate is usually not an organic process- a subtle difference never noted. 
So a product that is supposed to prevent cancer can easily become one that most defintely does.
    An article by Dr. Liva ND RPh states that of the 30 turmeric products he tested, only 2 had levels near the ppm of less than 5 (USP guidelines) at near 6ppm; the next level was 18ppm on up to 3270ppm, all proven detrimental to one's health.
   Products have been recalled by Health Canada which was mandated to test supplements in 2004, some of them tumeric products because of the high levels of 1,2-dichoroethane.
  I also discovered testing is not done in the US nor is not required by the FDA which states that a manufacturer conduct tests only if they 'know' such banned substances have been used.
I assume then it pays not to 'know'. 
What manufacturer who uses a product that is cheaper will pay to discover if it is so because it used such banned substances?

Prognosis is good and this condition usually ends in 5-14 days. As a rock-climber, ice-climber and mountaineer, I also use it for treatment of sore back, muscles, joints and inflammation after a long hard climb in the mountains. It stays in my medical kit when on multi-day trips. I've even used it on sprains and strains to help the injury heal faster and as an anti-coagulant to prevent blood clots. ",39

I based this trial on the reading of the new book by Linus Pauling, Vitamin C and the Common Cold. My life changed dramatically as I ceased getting colds as long as I kept taking at least 4-5 grams (4,000-5,000 milligrams) every morning without fail, and then an additional 1-2 grams after supper. Later, I found I needed more, and if I did begin to feel a virus coming on, I found that I had to take extra, up to 8 grams at a time, to stave off or reduce the impact and symptoms and duration. Often I need to then take an additional 2-4 grams every few hours in the first day or two to knock the virus out or almost out. If waiting more than a few hours when the very first symptoms begin to come on, it is less effective. If waiting more than a half a day it may do very little and you get the cold almost as you would without it. One thing I had to start doing after a number of years was take calcium and magnesium with the C to buffer it. I had big problems with ester-C and other pre-buffered C's which were too alkaline and messed up my gut worse than the pure C which is too acidic. I had to find a balance that worked for me. I have also successfully used C to stop the flu from progressing past the first few hours. C is the one vitamin I would never do without, if I could only afford to buy ONE supplement this would be it. I am amazed more people don't use it like my wife and I have learned to do, but you do have to take a LOT for it to really work this way. If you have a very direct exposure to a virus and not enough sleep, etc., then this will only do so much good, but normally it works incredibly well if you take it every day and take enough for you. There were a few times I tried stopping taking it but always got more colds again so went back.",19

I have moderate social phobia, and for the last three years have been experiencing symptoms of OCD and Panic Disorder. I have been prescribed klonopin for anxiety in the past, but only took it a few times because of the risk of addiction. So, I began searching for a natural solution to my anxiety problems. I have tried just about every vitamin or supplement that is said to help anxiety...Valerian Root, 5 HTP, B complex caps, and a few others. None of these supplements helped my anxiety like I'd hoped. I read a few articles online about how people with anxiety disorders can benefit from taking Vitamin C. So, I went out and bought some thinking that it was probably not going to work. Well, the day I bought them I took two 500 mg tabs, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. I felt calmer even the first day I took Vitamin C. I have been taking 1000 mg for the last few months and can't believe how I feel. My symptoms of OCD and Panic disorder are greatly reduced. I feel more calm now and I don't get stressed out easily anymore. I would recommend that anyone struggling with an anxiety disorder at least Give Vitamin C a try.

Sometimes I would get background headaches that would be on and off for several days. So we tried taking butterbur as soon as I got any early warning symptoms. Almost invariably, if I take it within half an hour of early symptoms, the migraine stops completely within 15 minutes. More than 3/4 of the time, if I take it after early warning, when the full headache starts, the migraine intensity is lessened significantly. Often, this is the difference between days of pain, and sleeping at night.
I don't take it every day as a preventative, just when I get symptoms or know I will be around a lot of triggers.

Not including simple mixes such as soda, or ""Red Bull"" like drinks which add caffeine, drinks like Tea, Coffee, and Chocolate (Cocoa) are for the most part derived from simple beans. Because beans haven't begun development yet they contain primarily simple compounds. Tea however is derived from a leaf. Leaves are complex factories that produce hundreds of compounds... one of which is Theanine. This compound counters the bad effects of Caffeine (more or less depending on leaf content). As a result Tea should be considered different from other drinks. Also if consumed as a whole leaf either steeped multiple times (Chinese method known as Gongfu) Tea  provides huge doses of antioxidents with decreasing levels of Caffeine allowing Tea to “Wake you in the morning, keep you throughout the day, and put you to sleep soundly at night.” This due to decreasing Caffeine, and the “soporific” (sleep inducing) effect of  Theanine.",2

I think it speaks for itself. I was told by my gasterointerologist that it is a great laxative. Just a word to the weary about that, I'm not sure how accurate the side effects page on this is listing diarrhea as a ""rare"" side effect, but I suppose the days where insomnia is your only company and the next day of work mocks you for it, on those days it's worth putting up with the less than pleasant side effects for the ability to stay up and get the job done. Just remember to back off the stuff when your hands start shaking, figure out how long it takes to get through your system and space out the caffeine in those intervals to avoid overdose. for me it's about 2-3 hours. Body weight plays a factor, I happen to be a lean man in his mid 20's, so you may have separate circumstances. It is easy to build up a tolerance similar to alcohol requiring substantially more to get the same effect. This also creates a chemical dependency that can cause migraines when your brain is deprived of it. I avoid this by putting up with the migraines for a few days and avoid caffeinated food and supplements for up to 3 months. After that time I generally have brought my brain's chemical dependency to next to nil and my tolerance back down to healthier levels.

Always in moderation, and remember, never do any physically demanding activities when you've taken caffeine, it reduces lung capacity and robs your muscles of nutrients causing them to fatigue very fast under strain. You can create heart problems if you are under it's effects and subject your heart to too much strain, your base heart rate is already elevated and the extra strain can be painful to endure.",24

I am a 60 year old female, and I have been taking co-Q-10 supplements daily for over 20 years.  I began taking it after reading a research paper that indicated that co-Q-10 might be effective in increasing immune response.  My whole life prior to that time, I was extremely susceptible to infections; if someone with the flu or a cold even looked at me across a room, I got sick.  I was constantly sick as a child, and as an adult suffered what seemed like a continuous cold throughout the winter, along with episodes of the flu, bronchitis, etc.  NOTHING helped, not dietary intervention, not the then-popular vitamin C dosage, nothing.  After several months of taking a combined dose of co-Q-10, vitamin E and lecithin (a cocktail suggested in the research paper), I noticed that I was not getting sick as often.  I have continued the same dosage since that time, and I have not had a single cold while taking it.  No colds, no flu, no bronchitis, nothing. I did suspend the dosage for several weeks two or three times, to see if it made a difference.  It did.  Caught a cold.  Started dosage again and returned to cold-free status. (I should note that after reading reports earlier this year that long-term dosage with vitamin E could be harmful, I discontinued the vitamin E portion of the cocktail.  I have not noticed any decrease in effectiveness).   So I am curious to know if there have been any further studies on this effect of co-Q-10.  Is it possible that this could be a placebo effect of such lasting duration?  What say you, experts?  Inquiring minds want to know. ^_^

It could be because CLA increases lean muscle mass. And, since even at rest,a pound of muscle burns more fat than a pound of fat, increasing your lean muscle mass helps you burn more calories. So I'm burning more calories and losing more fat. I'm sure the results would be even better if I incorporated more exercise. Right now, I have been inconsistently walking around my apartment complex (1 round only) 2-3 times per week. Before CLA, walking would help me lose maybe 1 pound in a 2 week period.  Then, I'd gain it right back. Not with CLA! I will continue to take my CLA supplements - it has made a remarkable difference.",95

It works very well with a combination of a proper diet and exercise but unlike weight loss pills, CLA promotes muscle growth at the same time. With the combination of muscle growth and fat loss, it may not appear that you are losing weight immediately since muscle weighs more than fat. I highly recommend using CLA if you are a person who is committed to exercising and eating healthy. Again, if you think simply taking this pill on it's own will benefit your weight, you will be disappointed. ",2

I also noticed a lack of the usual seasonal sinus infections and irritation I get during allergy season. The most surprising was that while on it, in addition to a new habit of jogging, I lost 20 lbs. Obviously the jogging caused most of this, but when I ran out of Cordyceps for a couple weeks I noticed that despite my regular jogging I began to have cravings for fatty foods and treats and wanted to fill my stomach up as I had prior to losing weight. I began the Cordyceps again and my cravings diminished and was again satisfied with eating just enough and not stuffing myself. I found it easier to make good food choices. I notice that I seem to have less episodes of heart ""palpitations"" especially if I drink alcohol or coffee, as I did before. I do not feel a ""rush"" of energy from the pills, but have noticed I am generally feeling better, even with lack of sleep. I look forward to the treadmill, and it's hard to say, but it seems it helps my motivation in that. I have been taking Cordyceps daily for a little over a year. ",123

I continue to have the same PMS symptoms with my cycle and the breast pain/swelling, bloating and water retention increased to an all time high. This is not an wonder pill that works all by itself. I recommend each person works with a qualified natural therapist to do a work up of hormones and endocrine system as well as nutritional deficiencies and sensitivities. I follow an organic diet free of allergens and only take primrose oil on day 14-28 of my cycle (it took time to figure out since I don't have one now) as it helps to boost progesterone. I also take daily vitamins, C, D3/K2/A, B-complex with extra B6, magnesium and natural thyroid. I also took measures in my home and personal products to remove any hormone and endocrine system disruptors that cause estrogen dominance symptoms. Look up Progestelle and Womens Voices for the Earth for help. Any Western GYN who will tell you that primrose oil causes more problems is due to the fact that they have ZERO training or expertise in nutrition and supplementation. They are not trained for wellness/health or an ounce of nutritional knowledge, they are trained to attack symptoms of illness with synthetic pharmaceuticals and surgery. Remember it is a business and they will only use modalities that make money. I should know, I have been a healthcare professional for 20 years and have extended training to the natural way because it is the only way out of this mess. Your body does not recognize synthetic substances with chemicals and additives in pharmaceuticals. At best they just mask the symptoms while your body is now required to deal with another foreign substance when it is already being blasted with chemicals throughout our environment.",19

I take 2000 mg of omega 3s in fish oil daily with fluoxetine (Prozac) and it makes a HUGE difference.  I drive much slower, I'm much more patient, and people don't aggravate me half as much.

Fish oil works by reducing inflammation in the brain on a sub-cellular level which allows the neurotransmitters in the brain to be able function more efficiently without misfiring (which is believed to be the cause of many mood disorders).

Regardless if you're suffering general anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, or any number off issues, fish oil will only help.

Be sure to read the label, just because it says 1000 mg on the bottle means very little.  What is important are how many mg of actual omega 3s are in each capsule.  Most drug store brands have about 300mg of omega 3s and to be effective for mood disorders, you need 2000-3000 mgs of omega 3s daily.  Specifically EPA.

I have low blood pressure, chlorestorel is fine. I have been taking iron, 150 mg for over two years. Everytime I stop taking it, my iron levels plummet. If fish oil prevents blood clotting, ie thickening of blood,and can cause bleeding from the liver,, would taking this krill oil be causing me to lose iron? Just wanted to chime in with my theory. I think Ill stop taking it for awhile. The body doesnt need much fat. Hormones are made from chlorestorel. But think of the body as mostly water. What happens when you put oil, in water? It floats. Think of your blood. Basically, the oil is greasing up your blood. I have read studies about vit e and estrogen that state estrogen is inactive until activated by e, e is an oil. when activated by the wrong oil, it can trigger cancer. I even wonder if the body needs ANY external oils at all. This states that the omegas are not naturally made in the body. Then why supplument them?

Michael Bloch's team at Yale found that there was no *meaningful* connection between use of DPA/EHA and these disorders.  (The article: Mol Psychiatry. 2012 Dec;17(12):1272-82. doi: 10.1038/mp.2011.100. Epub 2011 Sep 20.).

Then again, the research does indicate that omega-3s are helpful for cardiac pathology, and certainly they don't *harm* you, so I'm going to keep taking them.  I'm just going to be careful not to spend a fortune on them, and not to ignore other treatment options and put all my eggs in the Omega-3 basket.

The IBS got to the point where I was having up to ten BM's a day - not diarrhea, just constantly in the bathroom. It was miserable -it was hard to go out for even a few hours. It actually caused me to change jobs from a 70% travel position to an inside position. I saw the 2013 NEJM data on the ineffectiveness of fish oil in cardiac conditions, saw my doc and told him I was going to discontinue the fish oil because it wasn't doing anything for the triglycerides and I saw no long term benefit. 4 weeks later ALL my IBS symptoms were gone.

Here are some symptoms I no longer have: tinnitus, high blood pressure, chronic fatigue.

One thing I *suspect* GB has done is to reduce the severity of a poison ivy rash. I get it late EVERY winter, and this year was no different...except in the severity. I still have the rash and redness all over my arms and some on my legs. However, there are no oozing, weeping blisters.

Last year, it was so bad that it went deeper than the skin and ate into my flesh in one spot...leaving a scar that's still there today. This year, it itches very little, the rash isn't very raised, and as I said, absolutely no blisters.

I'm wondering, because the GB plant can cause an allergic skin reaction, much like poison ivy...is it possible that ingesting the supplement has helped my body counteract the effects of poison ivy?",4

I didn't have depression, anxiety, or any mood disorder; apart from the hair-pulling, I was completely healthy. After stopping Abilify cold-turkey (my doctor at the time told me this would be okay; she was WAY wrong), I experienced an intense 5-day-long anxiety attack.  Just constant panic, depression, crying, and depersonalization. On day 5, the ""episode"" ended just as suddenly as it began.

Ever since then, I'd have weeks of normalcy--even a slight euphoria--and then about 3 days of anxiety and depression that would, again, start without warning, and end just as suddenly.  Sometimes it was 3 days, sometimes more; sometimes it was so bad I couldn't function. Some episodes were more mild, but still very disrupting my life. I also began to pull more hair than ever.

I saw many doctors and was diagnosed with everything from General Anxiety, to Postpartum Depression (I gave birth a year ago), to Bipolar disorder. I knew in my heart the Abilify had caused this, somehow.

I read in a few forums about people having great success with TwinLab Amino Fuel, L-glutamine powder, and magnesium (all three taken together in the mornings on an empty stomach--I take 40 mL, 1 teaspoon, and 250 mg, respectively). I decided to give it a try, since I was desperate, and Abilify had scared me off psychiatric drugs permanently.

Within a week, I felt a LOT better. I started taking another 250 mg magnesium before bed, and now (2 months later) I feel even better, almost 100%. I do get ""twinges"" of anxiety now and then, but they are so mild and fleeting, I barely notice them; on these days I take an extra magnesium midday. I know the other supplements are helping a lot too, but the magnesium is great just by itself. It feels like I have my life back!! Highly recommend no matter what kind of anxiety you have.",73

It is a relaxing, anti-stress drink, which I take at night (about 30-60 min. before bedtime),and it has helped me greatly in a number of ways:  Helps me to RELAX and SLEEP (I had been plagued with insomnia for years!), AND helps with REGULARITY (bowel movements, as I had also suffered with constipation my whole life).  I was diagnosed w/Fibromyalgia back in the early 1980's, and have tried so many different Rx's over the years, but would end up with unwanted side-effects from each med.  Now, I don't take any Rx meds, just the Natural Calm, plus have changed my diet, which has made a HUGE improvement!  If you're not familiar w/the Paleo diet, you would do yourself an unbelievable favor by checking into it.  It's basically eating REAL food, and eliminating all grains, sugars, and processed ""foods"".  Not only did it help with weight loss, but I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER in so many ways!  Less fatigue, more mental clarity, less fibro-pain, etc.  God bless each of you, in your quest to feel better and become a healthier individual!  :) ",88

IT WORKS.

But Big Pharma cannot control it, so therefore it is ""POSSIBLY SAFE"".

What a crock.

Indians have used it FOR CENTURIES.

'Big Pharma' RUINED my heart. 2 med' were mixed by a doctor who SHOULD NOT BE PRACTICING - 20+ Malpractice suits pending - but he goes on and on.

I got  antibiotic colitis, was told ""it was all my head"", and ended up with persistent atrial fibrillation. I pro-tennis athlete with ZERO heart history.

Long story short, segue 6 years LATER when I was FINALLY ably to receive treatment. My Ejection Fraction was down to 27/28%!!!

They asked if I could GET OUT OF A CHAIR, UNAIDED! I still had to work, teach, and play tennis LIKE THIS!

The cutoff for an Ablation (I wanted to start simple - not MAZE, Pacemaker, etc) was an E/F of 35%.

The surgeon told me there was ""no way"" to raise my E/F.

Started researching, and discovered a heart study with Pycnogenol.

45 days later, final Echo.

36%.

A 30% INCREASE.

Numbness? Tingling? At night, laying down?

Mine was increasing DESPITE a very successful Ablation.

Restarted Pyc', 3 x 360mg, spread out through the day.

Numbness and tingling (and right foot being colder) have dissipated to almost nothing.

My doctors are like 'ho hum', or ""hmmmmm"", but since THERE IS NO KICKBACK AS THERE IS IN ALL THE HIGH-END PHARMACEUTICALS?

You won't EVER hear about it.

Which is also why Big Pharma wants to make most 'alternative' (read: NATURAL) medicine ILLEGAL.

Trust me; If they can ban this stuff? It will come back, on TV, with a catchy little tune...PYTESTOLLLLLLL....la la la....

At $500+ a month.

Pricks.

Start reporting FACT.

It took me about a month of being miserable, a trip to my allergy doctor, and tons of blood work to realize that the serum was making my allergies WAY worse. The primary adverse reaction that I had was dry mouth and subtle swelling of my tongue, which was very scary.

But it grows best in places close to the equator.it's incredibly important to do your due diligence to research what variety you intend to take and its nutritional value.the variety that grows in India is actually the most nutrient dense. And was named plant of the year in 2008 by the National Institute of Health. it has also been quoted by John Hopkins University for saying it will in fact cure, treat, & arrest over 320 different diseases.it's also incredibly important to be seeing if your variety of Moringa is in fact organic, and it has to be fully organic. Which means no pesticides, herbacides or fungicides. it's also extremely important to look at how the tree was grown, and what conditions, and how the tree was harvested, which includes how it was dried. If it was dried in heat, or in the shade. Shade drying is much more expensive and time consuming, however it is critical to keep the bioavailabilityof the plant alive and heat/sun  drying will kill all of the nutrients which will mean you're basically eating grass clippings nutrition wise.my best suggestion to everyone reading this is to do your research, look for Moringa that comes with a guarantee in from a credible organic source.my own personal experience since I started using Moringa has been: I no longer suffer from the back pain the used to experience from being hit by truck 25 years ago, my energy levels are through the roof, my son who suffered from ADD issues have had phenomenal results with his mental clarity and ability to concentrate, my 4 year old daughter won't stop going through growth spurts, and we very rarely have a cold or the flu in our house.

I started with 2000mg once a day (as per the instructions on the packet) and have reduced that to 1200mg split into a morning and evening dose. I bought it in powder form (it is actually small crystals and not really a powder) and it took me a while to figure out how best to take it. The method that works for me is that I mix it in warm water and then add a dash of OJ. The warm water is so that it dissolves fully and the OJ is to avoid the unpleasant taste and the acidic aftertaste. At first I experienced heartburn if I took it on an empty stomach but that isn't an issue any more - perhaps because of the reduced dose or the OJ.

Because I can only take Tylenol and narcotics for pain relief I had to stop taking NAC since Tylenol and NAC  cancel each other out. My father with Asperger's took 1200 mg NAC daily for the last three years of his life. I provided him with NAC so he would continue taking it. What I noticed is the my father was noticeably happier since he no longer had OCD in the form of obsessing about past events ad nauseum and talking about it incessantly while taking NAC. My father's mother also exhibited that behavior. I could not get my son to take NAC. Since he is bipolar type 1 as well as has Asperger's a dose of 2400 mg/day is more in line with his needs. My son also has the form of OCD where he would obsess over past events. Being impulsive this type of OCD can get him into loads of trouble - interpersonally and with the law.,38

I've read NAC was used by the scientific community to see if the drugs are killing cancer cells through the common mechanism of increasing reactive oxygen species.  If adding NAC stops the action of the anticancer agent, than it is assumed it was acting through oxidative action. In April 2010, Korean researchers reported on the action of NAC in combination with a proteosome inhibiting chemotherapy drug known as MG132.

 

 First they showed that MG132 increased the amounts of ROS in lung cancer cells and as expected, the drug slowed the rate of growth of the cancer cells. Then they treated the cancer cells with NAC.  The drug no longer slowed growth rates.   I found the following at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center: And preliminary results suggests oral NAC may help reduce chemotherapy-induced neuropathy (18).

It has worked for the most part. No perfect pull free days yet, but  It has made my urges subside, and has made the pulling itself hurt, which is a good thing-I also have not been completely consistent with taking it, but am trying my hardest to do so...maybe once I start taking it religously, it will build in my system and the results will be much more drastic. I would definitely reccomend anyone who suffers with trich to try this supplement... personally, it has been a VERY positive experience to not have such uncontrollable urges, as well as actually feeling the hair come out...hurting when I pull is good as it makes me not want to do it as much, either.",18

I've gotten sick every 2-3 months and have take at least 10-12 days of antibiotics every time. It won't go away on its own. Someone at a health food store told me her brother has the same problem, and said he takes NAC once a day on an empty stomach and its much better. I started using it (I have to take Pepcid or Tagamet with it or it will make my stomach burn a lot). I was already using an asthma inhaler, ProAir, once or twice a day, and was coughing up thick yellow mucus for about an hour after using the inhaler.

After using the inhaler and NAC for a month, the mucus became less thick, and lost the dark yellow color.  I've been using it for about 3 months now, and don't need the inhaler any more!  I'm using it every 3-4 days just to be sure my lungs are still clear and they are. 

I am just getting over what was either a sinus infection or respiratory infection and had no mucus at all, and am feeling much better after being sick for about a week.  

This is the first time since about 1990 that I've gotten over a respiratory infection without antibiotics!!!  Last year I filled about 23 prescriptions for antibiotics.  I've had enough of that.

My doctor likes NAC and wants a lot of her patients to take it. Next time I see her I'm going to tell her about this.  If I don't get the respiratory infections all the time any more, it's a miracle!!",48

I was prescribed 20 mg of Prozac which I took for six weeks.  Although my mood was stabilized, I was suffering from severe side effects from the drug including laziness, inability to orgasm, dizziness, weakness in my hands/grip, hands trembling, and inability to concentrate.  I decided that the Prozac was not for me as living with the side effects was worse than living with the depression.  I have always been critical of pharmaceutical drugs and prefer homeopathic treatments when available.  A bit of research led me to Saffron.  I got it from Piping Rock and took a capsule the evening it arrived in the mail.  I went to bed and woke up feeling rested and HAPPY.  Happiness has eluded me for years.  That morning I did not take the Prozac and instead took the saffron.  I have been taking it for three days, morning and evening, and my mood has continued to be stable.  I have found joy in the little things in life and have even been silly with my husband and daughter (something that never interested me in recent years although I had always been a joyful person).  I did suffer some withdrawal effects from coming off the Prozac, like severe headaches and dizziness, but they seem to be subsiding.   I will continue to take the Saffron in place of the Prozac.  I cannot comment on long-term use as I have only been using it for a few days.

I read that saffron has proven to be helpful, so I thought I'd try it. The results are amazing. I put 10-15 threads of saffron in a cup, pour boiling water over it and let it steep for half an hour before drinking it. As another poster here suggested, I use ""The Gathering of Saffron"" brand which is available online. I feel like I have my life back.

So I tried this solution and much to my amazement within three days the itching stopped and by the end of a week the lesion had cleared. Then I substituted a yeast based supplement containing selenium for the Brazil nuts and the rash came right back within days. This result was perplexing. Then I tried a better grade supplement, Swanson Albion Complex Selenium and the rash cleared as it had with the Brazil nuts. So the type of selenium supplement makes a huge difference.

The drawback is that the increased estrogen from soy seems to increase my breast size, which is uncomfortable for me, since I'm already rather large, so I don't want to overdo it, I've also been trying black cohosh but I don't notice any difference from that, other than increased gas.  I'm looking through the online evidence and both treatments only have mild indication of helping hot flashes, but it is impossible to get a solid nights sleep with constant flashes. I am also trying to reduce caffeine and alcohol, getting more exercise and some sunshine",27

I have successfully used: Transfer Factor Plus, Glutamine Prime, Transfer Factor Belle Vie ( supports healthy female tissues), Transfer Factor Recall (supports a healthy brain), Enumme Toothpast, TF Gel for first aide on closed wounds, bruises and warts!!! and Probiotics all from 4life Research and have not needed to see a doctor or fill a prescription for Shingells, Gingivitis or fever blisters or anything. By way of explanation, my fever blisters were so bad that they ran along the dermatone going down my throat...it felt like I had strep every 3 weeks and it would last for 10 days. All that resolved in the first month of immune support with 4Life Transfer Factors. If I feel the Shingels or fever blisters or anything like a cold or flu coming coming I just triple my dose, add 4Life Glutamine Prime and chill out and the outbreak is thwarted by my immune system. When you take Transfer Factors they confer immunity and sometimes they help you to develop it, and sometimes they just get you through a tough illness quicker...like 24 hours instead of a week or two! I also have never needed a flu shot since I started using 4Life Transfer Factor back in 1998. In all the research I have read there is no indication that a strong immune response is anything but good and that it is a compatable with health and wellness. From what I have read Transfer Factors can be used by anyone except people that have had organ transplants.",5

I based this trial on the reading of the new book by Linus Pauling, Vitamin C and the Common Cold. My life changed dramatically as I ceased getting colds as long as I kept taking at least 4-5 grams (4,000-5,000 milligrams) every morning without fail, and then an additional 1-2 grams after supper. Later, I found I needed more, and if I did begin to feel a virus coming on, I found that I had to take extra, up to 8 grams at a time, to stave off or reduce the impact and symptoms and duration. Often I need to then take an additional 2-4 grams every few hours in the first day or two to knock the virus out or almost out. If waiting more than a few hours when the very first symptoms begin to come on, it is less effective. If waiting more than a half a day it may do very little and you get the cold almost as you would without it. One thing I had to start doing after a number of years was take calcium and magnesium with the C to buffer it. I had big problems with ester-C and other pre-buffered C's which were too alkaline and messed up my gut worse than the pure C which is too acidic. I had to find a balance that worked for me. I have also successfully used C to stop the flu from progressing past the first few hours. C is the one vitamin I would never do without, if I could only afford to buy ONE supplement this would be it. I am amazed more people don't use it like my wife and I have learned to do, but you do have to take a LOT for it to really work this way. If you have a very direct exposure to a virus and not enough sleep, etc., then this will only do so much good, but normally it works incredibly well if you take it every day and take enough for you. There were a few times I tried stopping taking it but always got more colds again so went back.",19

I read a few articles online about how people with anxiety disorders can benefit from taking Vitamin C. So, I went out and bought some thinking that it was probably not going to work. Well, the day I bought them I took two 500 mg tabs, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. I felt calmer even the first day I took Vitamin C. I have been taking 1000 mg for the last few months and can't believe how I feel. My symptoms of OCD and Panic disorder are greatly reduced.

I ingest a food or substance (like maltodextrin)
that triggers an inflammatory response.  Also
none of the prescription or over-the-counter pain
meds I have tried have helped with the bone pain.
I found out that I had become calcium-depleted from heavy-metal poisoning from a medical implant.
The intense bone pain has consistently responded to Calcium Supplementation which I take along with Magnesium and now Vitamin D.  These 3 working together have helped decrease the widespread muscle pain I experience part of every day. After
years of depletion and mineral imbalances because 
to the level levels of metal in my body, it is a
daily process to keep the muscle pain away or at least at much lower levels.  I no longer experience the bone pain at all unless I forget
to take these supplements for a few days. The
muscle pain is much trickier to control but I know
from experience that for me dietary restrictions,
Calcium/Magnesium in equal amounts and Vitamin D
especially when I can't get out in the sunshine are essential in controlling the recurring widespread muscle pain/spasms.
Reading others negative experiences with Vitamin D, I know first hand sensitivity response
reactions to foods, medicines, and additives that
others handle well.  But also I notice and have
experienced myself that doctors often prescribe
very large doses for all their patients without
starting them out at a lower dose (which may even
be equally effective) to try to minimize any sensitivity reactions or adverse side effects.
After 6 months on a certain medicine, I asked my doctor if she would increase my dose a little bit.  She ""tripled"" my dosage abruptly without ""titrating"" it upward slowly as recommended. 50,000 IU sounds like a lot

Muscle and Bone Pain
Are Vitamin D Side Effects


This is a side effect of vitamin d that is not so easy to remedy and is actually a sign that you really NEED TO CONTINUE taking the vitamin d. If you experience Pain from Vitamin D this very likely means that your bones have become somewhat demineralized from having vitamin d deficiency for a very long time. When your bones are demineralized and you begin Vitamin D Therapy, this can cause calcium to begin to go back into the bones. When the calcium goes into the bones it drags fluids with it. This fluid can actually cause a small expansion of the 'collagen matrix' inside the bones and this expansion pushes out against the exterior covering of the bone which is very inflexible and has extensive nerve endings. 

When this occurs, you can experience this as bone pain or even muscular pain. If you experience new or worsening pain from taking vitamin d, it is NOT Vitamin D Contraindication, a reason to be scared or to stop taking the vitamin d. If you continue with the Vitamin D Therapy, the pain should subside in several weeks. While uncomfortable, you will be better off in the long run if you manage the pain for this time and 'get through' to the other side.

I have had bone pains and fatigue when initially taking vits/minerals but it went away after a month. I look at it like this - after exercising, the typical feeling is soreness.  Upon consumption of anything, our bodies will experience some sort of physical/emotional/biological feeling because the body is trying to ""purify"" itself.  Symptoms and side effects are not the same thing.  Check with your Dr about what you're feeling and determine whether it is due to (in this case) Vitamin D, or if the Vitamin D is rebuilding your body and the pain is just part of the process.

It is about a year ago, my doctor said my D level is only 10.xx. I still can not handle D supplement in low does after that extreme dry mouth and eyes experience at 2 months ago.

Here is what happened to me in the past 1 year. 

1. No problem when I start took 50,000 iu once a week for few weeks. Its is D3 from fish with doctor's prescription.

2. Over energy when I took it few times a week. So, doctor want me take 2000 iu daily. But, I only took 1000iu two or three times a week. 

3. Maybe dry eye (not dry mouth yet) start when I took 1000iu every other day. I know I have dry eye issue because all new contact lens cause my eye dry. But, this maybe because I am almost 50, so dry eyes is very normal in my age when I wear contact lens. 

4. Check D level again, only 25. So, doctor still wants me to take up to 2000 iu per day.

5. I start experience extreme dry eye and dry mouth after had took 1800 iu or 15000iu per day. By the way, I also start took Calcium with D at that time.

6. Finally, I called doctor, and stop taking any D and Cal supplements. 

7. After stop it for few days, no extreme dry issue anymore, but still feel dry eyes, and still not dare to wear contact lens.

8. After stop a month, I feel much better, but still dry eyes (not extreme). Check D level again, it drop back to 10.50.

9. I try on very low does D once a while, all caused my extreme dry. D 400iu supplement, a cup of milk with D, or a cup of almond milk with D for few days.

Now, I decide stop any food or drink with D supplement at least 3 months. I am not sure what I am going to next.

After my unpleasant D experience, I start vitamin supplement searching, I found a lot of supplement also contains herbs. I also found 1 of my Cal + D supplement does contains a herb which I better keep away.

Dr. took blood panel & didn’t even mention my vitamin D score @ 15. When I researched it on my own I asked for the recommended 50,000 iu (D2) once a week for 8 wks. She said “I’ve been a dr. for 30 some years & vitamins are at the bottom rung of things that can be wrong with you.” She advised seeing a psychiatrist.

I gave her the name of Michael Holick MD, a pioneer in vitamin D research who has written a book, & also the site of the National Vitgamin D Council. At 9:00 am the very next day she called in the script. She had no clue about the importance of D or how to assess the numbers from the test. Apparently she did the research I had requested- thank God.

A tip for not having side effects with the high D dosage- take it with a large, fatty meal. It’s a perfect excuse to cheat & have fried foods or lots of butter without guilt. I have had no side effects by doing this (I think I read it on Cleveland Clinic or Dr. Holick’s site). Not through my regimen yet but am feeling brighter with more energy.

Just like educating my Dr., I plan to spread the word to everyone I know about the importance of D deficiency and how it also eventually leads to other serious illnesses. I live in Ohio & heaven knows we don’t get sun for a large part of the year. I am also fair skinned, so slather on the sunscreen in the summer. My body probably could never produce enough D on its own with these circumstances.

One dr. who has done many studies is calling D defiency an epidemic in this country, and unfortunately most doctors haven’t heard anything about it. It’s up to us to educate them!

I wish you all well, Ceci

After reading all your posts some people need to do a bit more research on Vitamin D dosage. There are 2 types of Vitamin D in the body. Vitamin D2 is created by the body and then gets transformed to Vitamin D3. Thi 50,000 IU of Vitamin D is Vitamin D2. This creates a high level of Vitamin D2 but gets slowly converted to D3. Vitamin D3 is what the body uses and no Doctor would ever give someone 50,000 IU of Vitamin D3. It takes months of a high level of Vitamin D3 intake to create toxic levels. So rest assured the 50,000 IU of Vitamin D2 is safe. I am being treated with 50,000 IU because I have had muscle spasm and bone pain for 8 years after I was finally diagnosed with Vitamin D Deficiency (20) I have to take it once a week and have only been doing so for 1 weeek. I did notice some severe muscle twitching, but it was in the areas that I have severe muscle spasm (trigger points). Twitching to me indicates that the D is working because the muscles are reacting to something foreign to them. Also, with any treatment, one should always give the treatment at least a month before discontinuing. We must remember that our bodies are lacking something that it needs and when our bodies get ""used"" to not having this, it will react as if it is a foreign substance and eventually our bodies will get used to the higher amount. I only gave three stars because I have just started the treatement. I will update after the treatment has completed.",193

I am supposed to take 1500 mg calcium and 2000 mg Vit D supplements also. I bought the petite Caltrate Citrate + D3 calcium (can be taken with or without food) and a high potency Vit D3 1000 mg per pill. I have been afraid to take the extra calcium and Vit D until I am done with the 50,000 mg. It just seems to be a large amount.  I go to an endocrinologist, and she faithfully tests my Vit D levels. When I first went to her she tested my thyroid because I was exhausted all the time and have body pains. My thyroid was l-o-w and am now on a 50 mg pill a day for that. I have hypothyroid (according to others I've talked to, this is not unusual as you get older). Due to this, my doctor started testing my calcium and Vit D. I can remember my mom telling me that I had rickets when I was a baby and would not walk. I do not know what the treatment was at that time, but I do know she took me to the doctor. My doctor was not surprised to hear this news since I have low calcium and Vit D. My energy level increased due to the thyroid treatment. I am hoping when this calcium and Vit D gets to working, my body will be pain free. I have never had any problems taking the high dose of 50,000 mg and faithfully take it once a week until it will be gone (I have great faith in my doctor). Then I will faithfully take the others daily and be retested again. I even double checked with the office girl about this and she called me back and said I was to take the daily supplements in between the 50,000 doses. I still think I know my body and am waiting until I take the last large dose before taking the dailies.  Hope this helps!",2

Have been taking Rx for 18 years and it DID save my life. Got better, but still never really felt 100% at any time over the years.

I read about Vit D3 deficiency (http://www.vitamindcouncil.org) and got tested (using the correct test (25-hydroxyvitamin D test, also called a 25(OH)D ) . I was woefully deficient (28). Need to be in the 50-80 range, so started with the 2,000 IU/day and then found the 5,000 IU pill at iHerb.com (FYI: use DAH122 for $5.00 off your first order - my gift to you, :)  ) 

Since taking the Vit D3, my mood has dramatically improved - to the point that I am NOT taking any pharmaceutical Rx for depression for the first time in 18 years! I am truly amazed. Also, my overall health is better, my 'bad' cholesterol levels are dropping, no colds - not even the sniffles - since taking Vit D3. I've LOST approx. 25 pounds (read this may be due to NOT TAKING the anti-depressant). 

I will continue to take Vit D3 until I die. Absolutely remarkable results! Living in MN coupled with Scandinavian heritage, this vitamin is a MUST. I would recommend you get your Vit D3 levels checked.. and remember, if the lab you Dr. uses is Quest, then you have to multiply your results by 1.3 to get a more accurate result. Quest Labs have 'issues' and  yes, you can Google it for yourself. And don't listen to those that say a range of 30-40 is 'normal' and 'fine'. READ the results of the clinical RESEARCH, even if it is lengthy and technical.. Please don't be swayed by the pharmaceutical companies (and the FDA's)disinformation.  Take charge of YOUR life and do the research! You'll be glad you did.

The brand I use is not listed (Healthy Origins), so I just picked one.

Problems included: severe fatigue, muscle pain, severe joint swelling and pain, bone pain, ""foggy"" feeling, sinus problems, ear problems, a positive ANA test result and breathing problems.  I've tried multiple treatments through several doctors and specialists.  Switched to a new doctor and - during intake - found low Vitamin D levels.  Doctor prescribed 100,000 IU's to be taken one time each week for four weeks (to be retested following).  Initially, I experienced an increase in pain, almost like a tenderness all over my body.  However, the joint swelling, pain, sinus, and several other problems have subsided and the tenderness is getting better.  It wasn't overnight, but I am getting better.

I would highly recommend this treatment.  I know some of the prescribed levels sound scary, but it has helped me to finally experience relief after 10 years of pain...and the level I am taking is short term.  Please stay at it as best you can, I experienced relief from my symptoms and I believe that you can as well, but you'll need to stick with it.

As an aside, my doc says if my numbers check okay at the end of treatment, then I'll move to a 1,000 IU daily supplement.

The only reason I rated the ""Effectiveness"" section with 2 stars was due to the fact that I haven't completed treatment yet. I haven't noticed any changes with my symptoms, but I'm not sure if my symptoms are due to the D deficiency and I'm only half way through the prescription I was given.  I know many people are hesitant to take 50,000iu (as I was and to be truthful it still gives me pause every time I take it) and I wanted to share my experience with others who are deficient. 

From all the research I have gathered over the last several weeks of reading up on the subject of D deficiency - this is something people shouldn't take lightly.  The medical community have finally realized that D deficiency leads to a whole host of medical problems.  Vitamin D can not only provide treatment for some conditions, but actually prevent others from occurring in the first place.  I couldn't deny the facts and knew I had to take this or possibly deal with greater problems in the future as a result of depriving my body of something it vitally needs.  

One other point I wanted to mention for others who might be going through the same experience I am and that's Vitamin D deficiency and an underactive thyroid.  The information on a possible connection  between the two conditions on medical sites have been sketchy - it's alluded to in some writings, but nothing concrete is documented.  Maybe it's wishful thinking on my part that the D deficiency is the cause for the thyroid problem, but only time will tell.  My thyroid is a little underactive, but yet my thyroid antibodies test is negative for hypothyroidism.  So, again, maybe there isn't a link between the two conditions. 

I will give another update if anything new happens, if not, I will give a final entry at the end of October when I go for another set of blood tests to see if the D has increased my numbers.",65

I think your doctor wants you to either take the 50,000 units weekly or the 400 units, daily.  You don't have to take both.  Start with the prescribed dose. You are usually only prescribed for a short time period.  If it's too much, or you don't feel good on it, cut back to the 400 units daily.  I am increasing my dose to 800 units slowly.  It has a nice side effect of lifting my mood.  Buy a good brand of over the counter D3.  Make sure your get the D3 and the other forms of D are synthetic. Susan",36

Even after stopping my daily weight lifting program three months ago I am still having normal, pain free, diarhea free daily bowel movements so it was not the exercise that contributed to my beating IBS.

 I have advised others to try it and they have reported the same results as myself. I have no idea why it works, I just KNOW that it does for me and perhaps it will help you as well.

I based this trial on the reading of the new book by Linus Pauling, Vitamin C and the Common Cold. My life changed dramatically as I ceased getting colds as long as I kept taking at least 4-5 grams (4,000-5,000 milligrams) every morning without fail, and then an additional 1-2 grams after supper. Later, I found I needed more, and if I did begin to feel a virus coming on, I found that I had to take extra, up to 8 grams at a time, to stave off or reduce the impact and symptoms and duration. Often I need to then take an additional 2-4 grams every few hours in the first day or two to knock the virus out or almost out. If waiting more than a few hours when the very first symptoms begin to come on, it is less effective. If waiting more than a half a day it may do very little and you get the cold almost as you would without it. One thing I had to start doing after a number of years was take calcium and magnesium with the C to buffer it. I had big problems with ester-C and other pre-buffered C's which were too alkaline and messed up my gut worse than the pure C which is too acidic. I had to find a balance that worked for me. I have also successfully used C to stop the flu from progressing past the first few hours. C is the one vitamin I would never do without, if I could only afford to buy ONE supplement this would be it. I am amazed more people don't use it like my wife and I have learned to do, but you do have to take a LOT for it to really work this way. If you have a very direct exposure to a virus and not enough sleep, etc., then this will only do so much good, but normally it works incredibly well if you take it every day and take enough for you. There were a few times I tried stopping taking it but always got more colds again so went back.",19

I read a few articles online about how people with anxiety disorders can benefit from taking Vitamin C. So, I went out and bought some thinking that it was probably not going to work. Well, the day I bought them I took two 500 mg tabs, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. I felt calmer even the first day I took Vitamin C. I have been taking 1000 mg for the last few months and can't believe how I feel. My symptoms of OCD and Panic disorder are greatly reduced.

 Strangely enough, I suddenly found myself having normal daily bowel movements WITHOUT pain or diarhea for the first time in over 30 years since turning 11 years old.

Even after stopping my daily weight lifting program three months ago I am still having normal, pain free, diarhea free daily bowel movements so it was not the exercise that contributed to my beating IBS.

 I have advised others to try it and they have reported the same results as myself. I have no idea why it works, I just KNOW that it does for me and perhaps it will help you as well.
For more info please watch my video on YOUTUBE titled BEAT IBS with WHEY PROTEIN.

Good Luck and my greatest hope for you is that you too can FINALLY lead a normal life as I do now!
