I was buying DHEA supp from my (old) rhumy's on site store and was still testing low for DHEA. Got my act together and went to Johns Hopkins. They said you just never know what you are getting in supps since they aren't regulated (wonder why I kept testing low?).
NOW that I am on prescription I can definitely tell a difference!!!  This is why you get a prescription! After 3.5 years I am actually sleeping, my energy is better, I am starting to do some exercising without it feeling like I shoveled snow for hours afterwards. So that should help with putting on some muscle mass. Which means in the long run it will help with osteoporosis. The doctor who saw me at Hopkins (the Director of the Lupus Center) actually did studies on DHEA herself. I cannot recommend trying this enough, it will change your quality of life. I have not experience any aggression, etc. Also, I am sorry the other reader experienced a DVT, but we don't know all the facts. We do know that just by having Lupus that a lost of us carry the marker that already increases our odds of having a thrombotic episode by 50%. Those are just the cards we've been dealt. :( So a lot of drugs will increase our risk no matter what - a life of risk vs reward.

I noticed the DHEA was keeping me awake and switched to taking it on awakening. Immediately, I had much more energy (how I NORMALLY felt years before). The energy lasted until shortly after lunch time. As such, I started taking another 25mg with lunch. This kept my energy levels normal most of the day. Mostly, I didn't take any DHEA in the evening so as not to affect my sleep. But if I was going out with friends in the evening, I would take an additional 25mg at about 4pm.  I took this twice daily (occasional 3x daily) DHEA for about 5 years when I noticed that it no longer supplied any additional energy. My energy levels are now  pretty much back to normal, which is probably why DHEA was not providing any additional energy. I've since stopped taking DHEA several months ago and have not noticed any drop in energy. If my energy levels should drop in the future, I will definitely try DHEA again.

I stuck with it for 6 months.  I was tired all the time and everyday I dredded my workouts and felt worse afterwords (tired, and slow to recover) thinking I'm too old for this.

I started NutraSystem and needed a vitamine suppliment.  Went to GNC and picked up the over 40 MegaMan w\25mg DHEA and added another 25mg DHEA because of the salesman's advise.  After 2 weeks of dieting and supplements I started working out.  I've droped 25lbs after one month.

I know that the weight loss came from my diet but the weight training and eliptical work I've been doing for 2 weeks has never been easer.  I'm not kidding...my energy level, endurance, muscle mass, power, and recovery time is astounding.  I KNOW it's not the placebo effect or the diet that's making my workouts easier and more productive.  
It is the DHEA!  
I'm still leary about all the negative side effects that I've been reading about but in my obese state I'll take a chance on the possitive changes that I've been seeing and feeling.  I'll make sure to write back if any symptoms or issues start.

Patients who take anticoagulants (blood thinners) or antiplatelet drugs (such as aspirin) to prevent blood clots should discuss the use of DHEA with a healthcare professional. Examples of blood thinning drugs include warfarin (CoumadinÂ®), heparin, and clopidogrel (PlavixÂ®). The risk of blood clots is also increased by smoking or by taking other hormones (such as oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy), and these should not be combined with DHEA unless under medical supervision."" http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natur al/patient-dhea.html

My age spots and plaque-like skin have virtually disappeared, my energy AND libido have substantially increased, my depression/anxiety changed to happy/calm, and my muscles are rebuilding and strong!

You MUST be AWARE of your own body and how it operates! AMA doctors CANNOT help much with ""holistic"" things or they get sanctioned--so if you have cellular resistance, your blood tests will NEVER be accurate, which is THEIR ""gold standard""/BS. 

I suggest that people really watch the BRAND they buy, as MOST are not tested for strength and have FILLERS that make absorption less likely! I take EITHER 25 OR 50 per day in AM--after 5 pm keeps me awake. Occasionally I take 25 2x day. Everyone is different! Do research on the BRANDS!

After reading a lot of abstracts via Google Scholar, I found a couple of studies where DHEA was successfully used as a first-line med for treatment resistant depression at fairly high. For the past six weeks or so I have been taking 100 mg a day (single morning dose) Swanson's brand and during that time I have managed to reduce my Effexor dosage to a single 150 mg capsule a day. 
Doses this high would not be viable for a younger person with high natural DHEA, which decreases with age. 
But I am a 50 year old woman, and restoring my DHEA to youthful levels seems to be working splendidly. 
(it is recommended to have your blood level DHEA checked before beginning supplementation and periodically after that, particularly if you are male).

I recommend each person works with a qualified natural therapist to do a work up of hormones and endocrine system as well as nutritional deficiencies and sensitivities. I follow an organic diet free of allergens and only take primrose oil on day 14-28 of my cycle (it took time to figure out since I don't have one now) as it helps to boost progesterone. I also take daily vitamins, C, D3/K2/A, B-complex with extra B6, magnesium and natural thyroid. I also took measures in my home and personal products to remove any hormone and endocrine system disruptors that cause estrogen dominance symptoms. Look up Progestelle and Womens Voices for the Earth for help. Any Western GYN who will tell you that primrose oil causes more problems is due to the fact that they have ZERO training or expertise in nutrition and supplementation. They are not trained for wellness/health or an ounce of nutritional knowledge, they are trained to attack symptoms of illness with synthetic pharmaceuticals and surgery. Remember it is a business and they will only use modalities that make money. I should know, I have been a healthcare professional for 20 years and have extended training to the natural way because it is the only way out of this mess.

Simultaneously, my depressed mood improved very significantly. Chicken or the egg?

Because dosage can be so confusing, I am providing the brand name, etc. I took ""Nature Made Fish Oil 1200 mg"", 360 mg Omega-3 twice daily.

I take 2000 mg of omega 3s in fish oil daily with fluoxetine (Prozac) and it makes a HUGE difference.  I drive much slower, I'm much more patient, and people don't aggravate me half as much.

Fish oil works by reducing inflammation in the brain on a sub-cellular level which allows the neurotransmitters in the brain to be able function more efficiently without misfiring (which is believed to be the cause of many mood disorders).

Regardless if you're suffering general anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, or any number off issues, fish oil will only help.

Be sure to read the label, just because it says 1000 mg on the bottle means very little.  What is important are how many mg of actual omega 3s are in each capsule.  Most drug store brands have about 300mg of omega 3s and to be effective for mood disorders, you need 2000-3000 mgs of omega 3s daily.  Specifically EPA.

I have been taking iron, 150 mg for over two years. Everytime I stop taking it, my iron levels plummet. If fish oil prevents blood clotting, ie thickening of blood,and can cause bleeding from the liver,, would taking this krill oil be causing me to lose iron? Just wanted to chime in with my theory. I think Ill stop taking it for awhile. The body doesnt need much fat. Hormones are made from chlorestorel. But think of the body as mostly water. What happens when you put oil, in water? It floats. Think of your blood. Basically, the oil is greasing up your blood. I have read studies about vit e and estrogen that state estrogen is inactive until activated by e, e is an oil. when activated by the wrong oil, it can trigger cancer. I even wonder if the body needs ANY external oils at all. This states that the omegas are not naturally made in the body. Then why supplument them?

I always take Omega 3 with a meal, but the symptoms have become so uncomfortable, that I have stopped it. I even tried the over the counter capsules again, and I am getting the same side effects. 
I am sure it is the Fish oil causing stomach distress, after the process of eliminating all other possible causes. I may give myself a rest for a few weeks and try again, but intestinal problems are some of the side effects listed for all Omega 3 fish oils.

There's no *perceptible* difference that I can feel, and the very latest research from Yale, where the scientists combed through all the studies, is that the studies just don't show a connection between ingestion of EPA/DHA and relief of bipolar or depressive symptoms.  Michael Bloch's team at Yale found that there was no *meaningful* connection between use of DPA/EHA and these disorders.  (The article: Mol Psychiatry. 2012 Dec;17(12):1272-82. doi: 10.1038/mp.2011.100. Epub 2011 Sep 20.).

Then again, the research does indicate that omega-3s are helpful for cardiac pathology, and certainly they don't *harm* you, so I'm going to keep taking them.  I'm just going to be careful not to spend a fortune on them, and not to ignore other treatment options and put all my eggs in the Omega-3 basket.

The first 6 months went fine - no adverse events, but not much effect on the triglycerides. After 6-8 months, I slowly developed irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). I had been on the fish oil for so long, it did not occur to me that it could be the cause. The IBS slowly got worse to the point where I was tested for celiac disease and gluten intolerance - negative on both fronts. The IBS got to the point where I was having up to ten BM's a day - not diarrhea, just constantly in the bathroom. It was miserable -it was hard to go out for even a few hours. It actually caused me to change jobs from a 70% travel position to an inside position. I saw the 2013 NEJM data on the ineffectiveness of fish oil in cardiac conditions, saw my doc and told him I was going to discontinue the fish oil because it wasn't doing anything for the triglycerides and I saw no long term benefit. 4 weeks later ALL my IBS symptoms were gone. I told my doc and he was as shocked as I was - he'd never seen delayed onset IBS with fish oil. So if you have developed IBS in fish oil, talk to your doc and tell him that it can happen. It sucked, I'll never touch that product again as long as I live. ",5

This treatment along with diet modification and added exercise has had an enormous effect in treating my depression symptoms. Also used are vitamin D and SAMe. The depression was improving with the fish oil alone as I was taking it 3 weeks before the other supplements and really kicked in after adding the other supplements. I have also noted other health benefits like most of my knee pain is gone and the swelling from my recent knee replacement has greatly diminished. It could be coincidence but I have not had an asthma attack since using the fish oil.,20

I took this and the very next pregnancy was carried to full term with a healthy baby as a result.  Not only that though - my chronic fatigue, depression, neurological issues, and memory loss all immediately and dramatically improved.

Folic acid is synthetic and cheap - but it is not what the body uses.  It has to convert it to methylfolate first.

Folic Acid and 5-MTHF or (L-Methylfolate) are different substances.  I wish Web MD would not lump them together.  Folic Acid is synthetic and it likely feeds cancer cells.  Folate occurs naturally in foods.  See this blog for the explanation. http://blog.designsforhealth.com/blog/bid/115121/ Folic-Acid-vs-Folate-Part-I

I hope WEB MD clears this up.  WEB MD is a great site with only occasional  misinformation.  So WEB MD, thanks for the site.

I use Metabolic Maintenance brand, 5-MTHF, or Methylfolate, 10 mg.  This is a generic version of the medical food Deplin.  Read the reviews for Deplin on Web MD.

this is a bunch of BS. i came to your websitefor info about folate ,folic acid,  man-made, folacin,good , or not good or what
my treatment isn't really any of your business what is important is that the info i was looking for you don't provide  that is which forms are natural and which if any are man made (and therefore suspect to being bad or ineffective). there was no way provided for a curious user to ask questions
no way to expand knowledge beyond a dictionary definition. you should be more than that.

Medicals don't look at psych meds.  At last a great Doctor started me looking at deficiencies. Depacote caused 5 in me, including l-carnatine.  My period returned the day after I started it, but I have to increase it slowly, to keep everything balanced.  My thyroid levels went down, my mania went up, so I'm back on Lithium and increasing thyroid again.

But I had started dying. It's slow, but I can live and go back to work after 12 years.

I thought I needed more (I take a lot of Depakote!) but I will try taking it on an empty stomach first.  All this could have been spared if any of over ten docs or shrinks were aware of it!  I am so glad for this web site!

I'm using NOW's plain old L-Carnatine.  Weight loss would be nice, but I can do it on my own (I have) if I don't have ten deficiencies to fight with.",4

I didn't have depression, anxiety, or any mood disorder; apart from the hair-pulling, I was completely healthy. After stopping Abilify cold-turkey (my doctor at the time told me this would be okay; she was WAY wrong), I experienced an intense 5-day-long anxiety attack.  Just constant panic, depression, crying, and depersonalization. On day 5, the ""episode"" ended just as suddenly as it began.

Ever since then, I'd have weeks of normalcy--even a slight euphoria--and then about 3 days of anxiety and depression that would, again, start without warning, and end just as suddenly.  Sometimes it was 3 days, sometimes more; sometimes it was so bad I couldn't function. Some episodes were more mild, but still very disrupting my life. I also began to pull more hair than ever.

I saw many doctors and was diagnosed with everything from General Anxiety, to Postpartum Depression (I gave birth a year ago), to Bipolar disorder. I knew in my heart the Abilify had caused this, somehow.

I read in a few forums about people having great success with TwinLab Amino Fuel, L-glutamine powder, and magnesium (all three taken together in the mornings on an empty stomach--I take 40 mL, 1 teaspoon, and 250 mg, respectively). I decided to give it a try, since I was desperate, and Abilify had scared me off psychiatric drugs permanently.

Within a week, I felt a LOT better. I started taking another 250 mg magnesium before bed, and now (2 months later) I feel even better, almost 100%. I do get ""twinges"" of anxiety now and then, but they are so mild and fleeting, I barely notice them; on these days I take an extra magnesium midday. I know the other supplements are helping a lot too, but the magnesium is great just by itself. It feels like I have my life back!! Highly recommend no matter what kind of anxiety you have.",73

It comes in a few different flavors (all natural), and it can be found at Whole Foods stores.  I mix a heaping tablespoon with a glass of water.  It is a relaxing, anti-stress drink, which I take at night (about 30-60 min. before bedtime),and it has helped me greatly in a number of ways:  Helps me to RELAX and SLEEP (I had been plagued with insomnia for years!), AND helps with REGULARITY (bowel movements, as I had also suffered with constipation my whole life).  I was diagnosed w/Fibromyalgia back in the early 1980's, and have tried so many different Rx's over the years, but would end up with unwanted side-effects from each med.  Now, I don't take any Rx meds, just the Natural Calm, plus have changed my diet, which has made a HUGE improvement!  If you're not familiar w/the Paleo diet, you would do yourself an unbelievable favor by checking into it.  It's basically eating REAL food, and eliminating all grains, sugars, and processed ""foods"".  Not only did it help with weight loss, but I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER in so many ways!  Less fatigue, more mental clarity, less fibro-pain, etc.  God bless each of you, in your quest to feel better and become a healthier individual!  :) ",88

However, a year ago I began experiencing issues with peripheral vascular disease associated with varicose veins (ulcerations and subcutaneous bleeding on my calves, joint pain and stiffness, planar fasciitis and chronic leg cramps). 

Within weeks of treating my varicose veins with compression stockings and elevation, I noted increased postural tachycardia, which became debilitating after 3 months (could no longer work). While waiting to see my PCP, I came off the melatonin and both my tachycardia and varicose veins began improving significantly. Three weeks after discontinuing its use, the tachycardia disappeared and the varicose veins improved enough to allow me to go without compressions stockings for intervals of several hours.

Have found nothing to explain the correlation but for a study in European Journal of Phramocology, vol 345, 1 March 1998 (NIH medical journal database), where the authors discuss the presence of MT1 & MT2 receptors (to which melatonin binds) in smooth muscle of vascular tissue and their role in vasodilation and constriction, respectively, as an explanation for melatonin’s systemic efficacy.

While my overall condition improved when I discontinued use, I did experience a brief period of cognitive impairment and an uptick in mean blood pressure, the latter of which may require me to seek treatment should it persist. Finally have a follow-up with a cardiologist.

But the problem is, each brand and dose of melatonin (and possibly each ""batch"") is SO different. A few brands have worked consistently better than prescription sleep aids for me, but unfortunately MOST brands are either ineffective, or produce the opposite effect desired (eg, I needed a Xanax to counteract the nervous, gittery feelings, then I still couldn't sleep but at least I wasn't jittery.)

One 3mg brand I like is pretty consistent for me (and $3/month! cheap!), but the same brand has a few other doses, plus a ""dissolvable"" 3mg dose with sweetening added, and of course all the bottles look the same, so I've accidentally bought the wrong ones (or if the right ones were sold out, tried another dose): ALL the other doses of the ""good brand"" didn't work. And the sugary one gave me the ""nervousness"" effect.

After a few YEARS of trying melatonin for sleep (on and off), though I have a decent one now, I really think the FDA should be looking at what these vitamin companies put into these pills. At least there should be consistency from ""batch to batch"" (same brand/dose).

So when you hit luck with a good one, it's very effective. But it really feels like a crapshoot when you open the next bottle. I'd love to put my brand/dose as 5-star satisfaction, but since this review is just ""melatonin"", I've got to consider the rest of my experiences with melatonin. Mostly positive, but even the few times I've gotten ""the jitters"" ...why package and sell a sleep aid that makes insomnia a nightmare? It makes it tempting to go back to prescription meds (where the FDA at least has a say).",69

I like that it is not addictive. I particularly like it when my schedule is irregular and I need to get to bed earlier than normal for an early am appointment. It gets you sleepy in about 20 mins. (of course it's best to start settling down for the evening). It is a dream enhancer though, the higher the dose as in 5-10mg the more one will tend to dream. This can make one feel as though they haven't slept. Best to start with a small dose and increase until you find a dosage that makes you sleepy in the 20 min range. Then go to bed. If you don't your body will just work it through and it will do no good. I also like to combine this with Valerian root which produces a sound sleep. Also non addictive. One of each on any given work night is about the right dose for me.  The melatonin dose is 1mg and the valerian is 500 mg.  I have taken up to 10 mg of melatonin with no ill effects, however you will need 8-11 hours of sleep with that dosage and you may still wake up groggy.

I've tried a number of brands of melatonin, but many don't work. I've settled on Natrol, because it works. There are probably others that work also, but I haven't seen any reason to experiment unless/until the Natrol becomes unavailable or stops working. Remember that these are not manufactured as drugs and there is no required test for what's in the tablet. If the first brand doesn't work for  you, try others until you find one. That doesn't mean you will necessarily succeed - melatonin doesn't work for everybody. Try it, though. Start with low doses and adjust as you see how it affects you. Good luck!",54

1202,11,4/28/2014 9:01:30 PM,Benzodiazepine withdrawal,"John shepherd, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months",3,5,3,"Benzodiazepines cause tolerance and physical dependence within two to four weeks, and, upon cessation acute withdrawal traditionally requires tapered management. Additionally in some long term users experience withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal syndrome can last many months and is typified by a major depressive episode, agitation, and lack of ability to get to sleep. This is a serious side effect which needs careful monitoring.
ol
For this reason Benzodiazepines need to be used with extreme caution and for very short periods.

Melatonin is effective for sleep disturbances that are not caused by an over active nervous system, such is in the case of Benzodiazepine withdrawal. It appears virtually ineffective during acute (tapered) withdrawal, although somewhat helpful during withdrawal syndrome. For this reason it's main purpose during withdrawal is an adjunct with other therapies.

To my knowledge Melatonin does not effect the calcium channels that have been disturbed by benzodiazepine usage and this is why, in my view, Melatonin is not very effective on it's own as an Anxiolytic (antianxiety agent.)

My experience is that SSRI's are not very effective for use for withdrawal, however responses to SSRI's are individual dependant.

It is essential to manage benzodiazepine withdrawal and protracted withdrawal syndrome using a variety of methods including CBT, but most effectively, using an alternative Anxiolytic, the most effective of which is Phenibut (CALMEXA).

Phenibut Calmexa is GABA with a phenyl ring that allows it to pass the blood brain barrier, therefore replacing the GABA depleted by benzodiazepine dependence. With medical management it can safely and entirely replace the use of Benzodiazepines, causing an alternative dependence both easier to taper with less risk of protracted withdrawal syndrome. 

Melatonin used together with Phenibut is very effective for inducing sleep, establishing and maintaining a sleeping pattern.

We've been using it for about 4 months now and he takes a full pill about 30-40 minutes before bed and it works wonders. He slows down, sits for a bit to have a small healthy snack then he's ready for bed. It has created a GREAT bedtime routine for him and definitely helps him slow down his hyperness. He actually forms an attention span during his slow down time that he has a chance to relax.  We have not noticed any side affects at this time with him and he takes it voluntarily by mouth.

I take 3mg of melatonin approximately mid-day to advance my sleep phase.  The timing needs to be precise in relationship to my internal body clock, which is not always easy to know.  If I wake after an hour of heavy dream sleep, my waking time is a reliable marker and I will take melatonin eight hours later.  If I hit the right timing window, I'll have fairly strong fatigue within an hour.  This lasts for a couple of hours.  I can't do certain kinds of work in this state, but I can do housework and listen to lectures.  I call it my stupid pill, but it doesn't actually make me stupid, but impairs my ability to generate outward focus.  Missing my window even once can make it hard to recover the required timing accuracy.  The difference is profound.  I can tell I miss the window because I have far less fatigue.  Taking coffee at the same time as the melatonin significantly reduces fatigue, but it also made the treatment less reliable.  Used to have an ""all nighter"" without fail at least once every three weeks for twenty years.  In my first year on melatonin, I lost control only three times and had to flip over.  Variability in the potency messed me up on one of those.  One vendor didn't work at all.  Another vendor works well most of the time, but some bottles aren't all there.  Think I get mild stomach irritation at night, nothing really to complain about, and it could be other things in the pill.  My life is spectacularly better since I discover this, having found the research myself.  Would love to find a 100% consistent formulation.

Basically, my problem is pain, fatigue, overtaxed brain, and progressive weakening of cellular functions. Unclear, shifty diagnoses for the past 12 years by doctors who don't give a damn(CFS, Fibromyalgia, Ankylosing Spondylitis, Fibrocystic breast... and the eternal 'anxiety-depression')now blending with ageing.
Watch for whether you actually need it. If you don't (especially young males), it will push you too far, like caffeine or chocolate can. If you notice easily a beneficial effect, may be you do need it. 
Watch for dose. High-doses can be counter-productive and push you over the edge, push you down, unless you have alzheimer or parkinson. 
I take 5mg and that's plenty. I combine it with an aminoacid treatment.
The best effect is to give enough energy to prevent high-need reactions: it helps strengthen my breathing muscles and sleep better for example. If I don't do any hard work (computer, physical labour, hiking, mental focus, social stress...), I take it at night, for more recovery deep sleep. Otherwise in the morning. I have taken it for 8 months, and find no side effect nor need to increase dose (yet at leaast). 
It works on cellular energy and thus is more effective than raising norepinephrine with nicotine, doesn't have the side-effects and smoke associated problems.
It is basically a better treatment for adaptive 'failure' to cope than stress-sex hormones: does not run out.
I agree with others: not a placebo effect, and the trouble isn't in the mind but in the exhauting oversuse of the brain-central-control, which ends up weaking the body, the cells. NADH compensates, gives a break to the exhausted brain, and helps the body without using it as a resource to fuel the brain. Don't bother with doctors who don't have an adequate intellectual framework to understand the 'ups & downs' that plague women more than men.

Second, because of the first problem, it becomes very expensive to take in useful dosages.  Typically it is in 500mg caps, so it takes 5 caps to reach my 2.5g. The standard packaging usually is only 60 500mg caps, which is supposedly for 30 days but is a inadequate dose for treating ED.

But D-Ribose made me very sick for days. I kept taking it, thinking that maybe I just need to get used to it.  It felt worse than coming off of lyrica (which was a horrible drug for me).  I had horrible headaches, severe physiological anxiety throughout my body, crawling out of my skin, I wasn't able to think straight.  My brian felt like it was moving through mud.  I had a very difficult time speaking and writing work emails.  My muscles ached even more, and walking up stairs was so difficult, as I felt every muscle in my legs strain to work.  I still feel hungover from these horrible days.  I am writing this so that others can be aware, as no one has written about side effects like these.  I took only one to two teaspoons a day (dosage is one to three teaspoons a day).  I am 28 years old and have battled with FM throughout my 20s.  I was once a happy, vibrant, athletic young person- now I am always exhausted, in constant pain, anxious, sad, irritable- just struggling every day to support myself and to try to make some life for myself, while this crippling condition ruins everything.  So try Ribose, as it makes sense that it would work.  But we aware of negative reactions and stop taking it if you feel like crap.  Cause I lost days out of my life feeling even more like crap than I already do, and am even more behind on life.  I have tried everything, and I will continue to try everything.

I have successfully used: Transfer Factor Plus, Glutamine Prime, Transfer Factor Belle Vie ( supports healthy female tissues), Transfer Factor Recall (supports a healthy brain), Enumme Toothpast, TF Gel for first aide on closed wounds, bruises and warts!!! and Probiotics all from 4life Research and have not needed to see a doctor or fill a prescription for Shingells, Gingivitis or fever blisters or anything. By way of explanation, my fever blisters were so bad that they ran along the dermatone going down my throat...it felt like I had strep every 3 weeks and it would last for 10 days. All that resolved in the first month of immune support with 4Life Transfer Factors. If I feel the Shingels or fever blisters or anything like a cold or flu coming coming I just triple my dose, add 4Life Glutamine Prime and chill out and the outbreak is thwarted by my immune system. When you take Transfer Factors they confer immunity and sometimes they help you to develop it, and sometimes they just get you through a tough illness quicker...like 24 hours instead of a week or two! I also have never needed a flu shot since I started using 4Life Transfer Factor back in 1998. In all the research I have read there is no indication that a strong immune response is anything but good and that it is a compatable with health and wellness. From what I have read Transfer Factors can be used by anyone except people that have had organ transplants.",5

I could not think very clearly. I was laying down to rest 12+ hours per day late Spring of 2012. I was not sleeping very well. I would get winded very easily. I felt panicky sometimes at the gym, or simply doing relatively light activities. A medical professional later explained to me that I was air-starved due to lack of iron. I was put on an anti-depressant early May 2012; the dose was increased from 10 mg to 30 mg over about a 6 week period. The anti-depressant didn't seem to help. Finally a nurse practicioner recommended a blood test to check for thyroid issues, vitamin D and iron. My thyroid was fine. I was anemic,my iron stores were extremely low & vitamin D-3 was low. I was told to start taking an over-the-counter,45 mg slow release iron pill. Vitamin D-3 was increased from 1,500 IU/day to 3,500 IU/day  I felt MUCH better within a couple of days. Pretty much normal within a week. I was told the anemia would go away relatively quickly, but the iron stores take a long time to improve. I still take the iron supplement every day with dinner. I forget occassionally, but it doesn't seem to matter. Vitamin D-3 in the a.m. I called the NP & weaned myself off the anti-depressants over a 2 month period in Nov/Dec of 2012; that was a good choice in my case as I noticed no difference. After 3 months my blood was rechecked. The iron stores were still very low, but coming up. I have been told to get my blood checked about every 6 months or so to ensure the iron levels aren't too high or low as iron poisioning can happen. I need to lose about 20 lbs as a result of this whole episode. I'm not sure what caused the weight gain. It may have been as simple as feeling better and consuming too many calories combined with a new job & lack of regular excercise! Continuing with my iron supplement; regular excercise;  adequate sleep; moderation with alcohol & portion control are my focus now.",81

I'm not a person who takes medications or natural remedies (low T was the first time I went to a doctor in 6 years), which is why I think I didn't notice a change until I stopped using it.

I read the reviews of R. rosea, and they were almost all positive, so I bought the Swanson 400mg capsules just because I was curious about it.  I am overly sensitive to a lot of drugs.  Two beers and I'm buzzed, one cup of coffee and I'm super jittery and can't sleep.  So I knew I needed a smaller dose.  It's apparently hard to find in capsules smaller than 400mg.  So I have been unscrewing the capsule and taking only about 1/8 to 1/4 of it (50-100mg), just once in the morning when I wake up, and only take it once every 2 days.  It definitely has stimulant properties.  I've seen many benefits and only 1 or 2 negatives (that may go away over time).  Benefits: More energy, similar to caffeine but without feeling jittery, and no afternoon crash.  Better focus at work without getting tired, along with less anxiety from work stress (priceless). A slight euphoric feeling for the first couple of hours after I take it.  A slight increase in heart rate.  Less snack cravings.  I feel more outgoing and less introverted (I'm normally a quiet guy).  My workouts have been easier in terms of perceived effort, and I feel less tired afterward.  I seem to recover faster than before.  Last but not least I have noticed my libido increase, which I honestly didn't expect at all.  The negatives: I get a slight headache about 2 hours after I take it, and it goes away by the afternoon.  The headaches seem to be going away slowly as I get accustomed to it.  The night of the first day I took it, I went to bed still having a lot of energy, and was unable to sleep for a while, so I took a tylenol pm, and fell right asleep.  Overall though, it's been great.  So glad I discovered it, and thanks for everyone who posted reviews of it!!",28

They looked like pimples but wouldn't pop and started spreading to my shoulders-upperback-and upper chest!! I am a freak when it comes to my skin.. i thought it was bedbug bites from staying in a hotel for 2 weeks while i was working.. When i first got it I took this for a few days out of one week. I never bothered to review it until now when i was just about to take my daily vitamins & give it another go.. anyways i thought i should look it up & read the benefits- it all seemed great, then i read the reviews & i found that someone else had the itchy bumps/hives occur.. Im still not positive if this is the reason for the bumps but they didn't start until after i took this now that i think of it.. Hope this helps.

For those problems, rhodiola has been remarkable. It provides an uplifted, buoyant feel and a sense of energy, without the jittery feeling I get when I used to drink caffeine for energy. So, for mood and energy I've found it to be great. HOWEVER, both my husband and I have noticed a notable loss of memory when taking it--can't remember names of people, or can't put a face with a name when I otherwise would. This change in memory was troubling enough that my husband quit using rhodiola. I try to use it only during the last two weeks of my cycle, when I am most prone to mood problems, and try to put up with the memory problems then.  I do worry, though, about what everyday or longterm use would do to memory.  I hope researchers will look into this rhodiola/memory connection.

I clean houses, and I hardly go a day without it, it is non-addictive and will not produce jitters or nervousness of any kind. You almost can't OD on it, but there are some concerns for heart conditions (usually only if you take a lot). Of course do your own thorough research and make your own well informed decision.

Reaction to this drug was extremely negative(constant extreme anxiety, paranoia and even a brief period of suicidal thoughts). Stopped zoloft and tried exercise plus diet and although I was not as bad, I still had issues. Read about rhodiola root and decided to try it due to the low toxicity. Started with 100 mg/day and within 24 hours I could feel the benefit. I wasn't in a permanently bad mood. After 2-3 days I was slipping back to brief anxiety attacks. Raised it up to 200 mg/day (first thing in the morning before breakfast and 30 minutes before lunch). 3 weeks later and I'm 100% better. I no longer have anxiety attacks even when doing presentations in front of large audiences. This herb has changed my life. I've read hours and hours of different reviews of various herbs and remedies. One thing I've learned is that each body is different and you'll need to try to see what is right for you. For me, this root has helped me. I've been fighting an inner battle of anxiety during public speaking for many years and no longer even have this issue.

I saw some relief, and was able to reduce the Neurontin somewhat. Symptoms returned to their previous state in about three years. I then found out about sublingual METHYL cobalamin b12 --  methyl b12. There is no apparent upper limit; I am symptomatic unless I take 150 milligrams/day, an enormous amount. I use Natural Factors sublinguals, 5000 mg tablets, and take 10 between my cheek and upper teeth, three times a day, usually at night. I built up to that dose gradually, according to whether symptoms had disappeared. Anything less methyl b12 and neuropathy -- pain and tingling and numbness in my feet and legs -- is back. Cause of neuropathy? I've had different diagnoses, but now it's more plainly Sjogren's Syndrome. I no longer have repeated falls due to numb feet. I can wiggle my toes again. BUT the first four weeks on b12 is no picnic; brain fog and headaches, for me. Very very difficult for people taking antidepressants, and of course you should stop taking PPIs, because they destroy b12 in the body. These changes are difficult; the rewards of taking b12 are tremendous, and many people don't need the amount I take. The best protocol for starting methyl b12 can be found online by searching for Freddd and b12. Medically necessary for people with stomach stapling or other reduction in stomach size.

I'm not a person who takes medications or natural remedies (low T was the first time I went to a doctor in 6 years), which is why I think I didn't notice a change until I stopped using it.  Less than 2 weeks after stop using it, I had no motivation again.

I've begun using it again, but more sparingly.  This ginseng increased my blood pressure by a lot; I have always had below average blood pressure.  It got the point I couldn't sleep at night only because I could feel my heart pumping and it scared me, so I had to quit taking it.

Since taking BCO my (AA 4C) hair has dramatically stopped shedding/thinning and is becoming really, really thick! REALLY!  

I was prepared to wait for at least 3 or 4 months for noticeable results, but it's only been 9 weeks and I can honestly say that these capsules are working.  

And I'm so, so, so, very relieved, because my hair has seriously thinned out and the shedding was causing a torrent of tears.  

I suggest ANYONE should give it a try.
